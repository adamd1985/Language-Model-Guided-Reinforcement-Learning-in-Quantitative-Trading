=== Judge's Evaluation: TSLA - Market Data Until 2019-11-01 ===

Based on the provided market data and news, predict the LLM’s decision:
News Factors Considered:
['**Tesla Inc.** (NASDAQ:TSLA) steps into the third-quarter earnings confessional Wednesday after the close of U.S. markets. Analysts are expecting that Elon Musk\'s company will report a loss of 46 cents per share on sales of $6.45 billion. Free cash flow is expected to be $32 million.\n\nCalifornia-based Tesla already reported third-quarter deliveries of 97,000 vehicles, which topped estimates, but was also viewed as a disappointing figure.\n\nSo there is some burden on Tesla heading into earnings, and it\'ll be about more than third-quarter results. Any indications the company can give up upside surprises to fourth-quarter deliveries and restoring a path to profitability will likely be well-received by investors.\n\nFor investors looking to play Tesla earnings via exchange traded funds, there are some compelling options, including the following funds.\n\n**ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK)**\n\nTesla Weight: 11.06%\n\nARK Investment Management, the fund manager behind the **ARK Innovation ETF** (NYSE:ARKK), is one of the most noted Tesla bulls in the investment community, a position that has subjected the firm to some criticism on Twitter. To its credit, ARK has been steadfast in its Tesla bullishness.\n\nMore importantly, Tesla has long been one of ARKK\'s top holdings and a major position in some other ARK ETFs --and those funds have performed brilliantly. ARK has a $6,000 price target.\n\nEven with that massive target, the firm has been paring its Tesla exposure this month, though in modest fashion. ARKK is an actively managed fund, so the issuer has the flexibility to alter its positions. Overall, the issuer has recently sold 150,000 shares of Tesla, reducing ARKK\'s Tesla stake from 12.75% to 11.06%. \n\n**VanEck Vectors Low Carbon Energy ETF (SMOG)**\n\nTesla Weight: 9.63%\n\nTesla accounts for 9.63% of the **VanEck Vectors Low Carbon Energy ETF**(NYSE:SMOG), making the stock the largest holding in this recently reconfigured fund. SMOG tracks the Ardour Global Index.\n\nThat index "is intended to track the overall performance of low carbon energy companies, which are those companies primarily engaged in alternative energy, which includes power derived principally from bio-fuels (such as ethanol), wind, solar, hydro and geothermal sources and also includes the various technologies that support the production, use and storage of these sources," according to VanEck.\n\nVanEck changed SMOG\'s investment objective just over three months ago. The fund has been a solid performer this year, gaining almost 19%.\n\n**First Trust NASDAQ Clean Edge Green Energy Index Fund (QCLN)**\n\nTesla Weight: 9%\n\nAnother passively managed fund, the **First Trust NASDAQ Clean Edge Green Energy Index Fund  **(NASDAQ:QCLN)\'s 9% weight to Tesla stock ranks in the top five among U.S.-listed ETFs. That\'s a long-held honor for QCLN because the fund is over 12 years old and is also one of the oldest ETF owners of Tesla shares.\n\nThe $115.49-million QCLN holds 42 stocks and has a median market value of $2.5 billion, which is low compared to other funds mentioned here.\n\nQCLN member firms include "companies engaged in manufacturing, development, distribution and installation of emerging clean-energy technologies including, but not limited to, solar photovoltaics, biofuels and advanced batteries," according to First Trust.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_A New Small-Cap ETF With A Buffer_\n\n_A Nifty Video Game ETF With Exciting Possibilities_\n\n_Photo courtesy of Tesla.  _'
 '### Gainers\n\n  * **Tesla Inc** (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares are up 19% after reporting third-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.91, well ahead of estimates. Sales came in at $6.3 billion, missing estimates by $40 million. The company says it\'s highly confident in exceeding 360,000 deliveries per year.\n  * **Microsoft Corporation** (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares are down 0.35% after reporting a first-quarter earnings beat. Earnings came in at $1.38, beating estimates by 14 cents. Sales came in at $33.1 billion, beating estimates by $870 million.\n\n\n\n### Losers\n\n  * **NetGear, Inc.**(NASDAQ:NTGR) shares are down 12% after reporting a third-quarter earnings beat. Adjusted earnings came in at 65 cents per share, beating estimates by 5 cents. Sales came in at $265.86 million, missing estimates by $6.36 million. The company issued weak fourth-quarter sales guidance.\n  * **Ford Motor Company** (NYSE:F) shares are down 3% after reporting a third-quarter sales miss. Earnings came in at 34 cents per share, beating estimates by 8 cents. Sales came in at $33.93 billion, missing estimates by $50 million.\n\n\n\n**Tesla Inc** (NASDAQ:TSLA) posted adjusted third-quarter earnings of $1.91 per share against a consensus estimate of a 42 cent per-share loss on Wednesday. Sales of $6.3 billion missed the $6.34-billion Street estimate.\n\nTesla reported $5.3 billion in cash on hand and positive free cash flow of $371 million.\n\nThe automaker said its Shanghai Gigafactory is ahead of schedule, with trial production underway. Model Y production is expected to begin by summer 2020.\n\nThe Tesla Insurance initiative launched in California in August is enabling many customers to cut their insurance costs by 20-30% and has drawn strong interest from new and existing customers, according to Tesla. The automaker said it\'s working to expand its insurance offering to additional markets.\n\nThe automaker fell short of analyst expectations when it reported 97,000 third-quarter vehicle deliveries Oct. 2, 2,000 shy of the consensus forecast of 99,000 deliveries.\n\nTesla said Wednesday that it expects to exceed 360,000 vehicle deliveries in 2019.\n\nTesla\'s stock was rallying more than 14.5% to $291.75 in the after-hours session. The stock closed at $254.68 per share.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Tesla Is By Far The Most Profitable Short Trade Of 2019_\n\n_3 ETFs For Tesla Earnings_\n\n_Shanghai Gigafactory photo courtesy of Tesla._\n\nSelf-driving startup Zoox has raised $200 million in new convertible note funding, according to media reports. The raise is part of a Series C round that is expected to close later this year or early in 2020.\n\nInvestor names were not disclosed. \n\nFounded in 2014, the Foster City, California-based Zoox stands out from the self-driving vehicle crowd with its plan to build a custom robo-taxi instead of retrofitting existing vehicle platforms.  \n\nThe company, which  previously raised a $465 million Series B round, has been testing on public roads in San Francisco and more recently in Las Vegas. It joins competitors such as Cruise, which raised $1.15 billion in May, and Argo AI, which signed a $2.6 billion partnership with Volkswagen in July.\n\nEarlier this week Zoox co-founder and CTO Jesse Levinson took a swipe at another self-driving competitor, Tesla, saying the Elon Musk-led electric car maker has "no chance" of  developing autonomous driving technology by its stated 2020 goal, TechCrunch reported. \n\nThe comments, delivered during a conference in San Francisco on October 22, come as **Tesla Inc  **(NASDAQ:TSLA) is rolling out functions of its Full Self-Driving suite, which Elon Musk has said will soon be "feature complete."\n\nTesla is set to disclose its third-quarter earnings today after market close.\n\nImage Sourced from Pixabay\n\nLongtime investors know the stock market is forward-looking. That means a stock\'s share price is more a reflection of what investors collectively think the company will do in the future than what it did in the past or what it\'s doing in the future.\n\nThe forward-looking nature of the stock market makes sense if you consider why people buy shares of stock in the first place. People don\'t typically buy a stock and hope the stock price remains the same. They\'re hoping the share price goes up because they\'re anticipating good things from the company\'s future.\n\nGrowth stocks like **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) and **Netflix, Inc.** (NASDAQ:NFLX) have led the market higher throughout much of the past decade. They haven\'t always been the most profitable stocks, but their massive returns have come due to investors expectations of their long-term revenue growth.\n\nAmazon and Netflix are just now starting to convert their large revenue growth to earnings, but investors that have waited to this point to buy the stocks have missed out on huge gains.\n\n### Sales Growth Stocks\n\nHere are the 16 S&P 500 stocks with the biggest revenue growth over the past five years, according to Finviz:\n\n  1. **Diamondback Energy Inc** (NASDAQ:FANG), 59.9% growth.\n  2. **Broadcom Inc** (NASDAQ:AVGO), 52.6% growth.\n  3. **Nektar Therapeutics** (NASDAQ:NKTR), 51.6% growth.\n  4. **Facebook, Inc.** (NASDAQ:FB), 48.0% growth.\n  5. **Allergan plc**(NYSE:AGN), 43.4% growth.\n  6. **Arista Networks Inc** (NYSE:ANET), 42.9% growth.\n  7. **Centene Corp** (NYSE:CNC), 40.8% growth.\n  8. **Charter Communications Inc** (NASDAQ:CHTR), 39.9% growth.\n  9. **Incyte Corporation** (NASDAQ:INCY), 39.6% growth.\n  10. **Twitter Inc**(NYSE:TWTR), 35.5% growth.\n  11. **Kraft Heinz Co** (NASDAQ:KHC), 33.3% growth.\n  12. **ABIOMED, Inc.** (NASDAQ:ABMD), 33.2% growth.\n  13. **IHS Markit Ltd** (NYSE:INFO), 30.4% growth.\n  14. Netflix, 29.3% growth.\n  15. **Lennar Corporation** (NYSE:LEN), 28.2% growth.\n  16. **salesforce.com, inc.**(NYSE:CRM), 26.7% growth.\n\n\n\n### Benzinga\'s Take\n\nAs with any other single metric for evaluating a stock, there are caveats to high revenue growth. Some companies boost revenue by mergers and acquisitions, which may not be as sustainable as organic revenue growth.\n\nIn addition, high-growth stocks like **Uber Technologies Inc** (NYSE:UBER) and **Tesla Inc**(NASDAQ:TSLA) have struggled in the market because they have failed to demonstrate a clear path to convert their revenue to profits in the long-term.\n\n_Do you agree with this take? Emailfeedback@benzinga.com with your thoughts._\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_15 Stocks Projected To Have The Biggest 5-Year EPS Declines _\n\n_14 Stocks With The Highest Long-Term Projected Earnings Growth Rates_\n\nRoger DaSilva of Realm Capital Management spoke on CNBC\'s "Options Action" about unusually high options activity in **Tesla Inc** (NASDAQ:TSLA) ahead of earnings.\n\nThe company is going to report earnings on Wednesday and the options market is implying a move of 8%, which is slightly below its average move of 9%. It should be noted the stock dropped 15% on its last earnings report, which increased the average move.\n\n_See Also:Tesla Is By Far The Most Profitable Short Trade Of 2019_\n\nDaSilva noticed traders were recently selling to close the November $230 calls, locking some profits and they were buying the November $280 calls. They bought 6,000 contracts of the November $280 calls for $6.70, which sets the breakeven for the trade at $286.70 or more than 12% above the current stock price.\n\nThis year has been another disappointment for **Tesla Inc**(NASDAQ:TSLA) investors, with the stock down 23.7% year to date. However, Tesla\'s struggles have made it the most profitable stock of the year for short sellers, and it\'s not even close.\n\nTesla short sellers have netted a $2.03 billion year-to-date mark-to-market profit, according to S3 Partners. Not only does that big gain make Tesla the most profitable U.S. short of the year, Tesla short sellers\'s gains dwarf all other stocks.\n\nTesla\'s closest competition is **DuPont de Nemours Inc** (NYSE:DD). But Tesla short seller\'s $2.03 billion profit is more than three times the $657.5 million gain DuPont short sellers have enjoyed.\n\n### Taking Profits\n\nTesla short sellers have been taking some profits off the table heading into Wednesday\'s third-quarter earnings release.\n\n"TSLA\'s +5% October price move and nearly three million of short shares covered looks like more recent short sellers are closing up their positions to realize what is left of their 2019 profits, S3 analyst Ihor Dusaniwsky wrote in a report this week.\n\nTesla shares are now up more than 40% from their 52-week lows, and Dusaniwsky says short sellers have been feeling the heat in recent months. However, the gradual rise in Tesla\'s share price and the plentiful supply of shares to borrow hasn\'t triggered a classic short squeeze at this point.\n\nTesla\'s total outstanding short position is down 26% in the past five months, but it\'s still the second-largest short position of any U.S. stock. Tesla has an $8.39 billion outstanding short position, roughly 23.4% of the stock\'s float.\n\n### Benzinga\'s Take\n\nTesla is certainly primed for a potential short squeeze if the company can consistently beat market expectations in the next several quarters. However, Tesla bulls have been waiting for this short squeeze for years, and it hasn\'t come.\n\nTesla\'s inconsistent financial performance and inability to hit its production and delivery targets are the primary reasons the stock is up less than 10% overall in the past five years, generating less than 20% of the long-term return of the overall S&P 500.\n\nTesla\'s stock traded around $254.28 per share at time of publication.\n\n_Do you agree with this take?

 'It\'s been a rough year for **Tesla, Inc.** (NASDAQ:TSLA) investors, with the stock down more than 10% year to date overall even after a huge 16% gain on Thursday following a third-quarter earnings beat. While Tesla bulls celebrate the long-awaited good news, Tesla short sellers are getting torched.\n\n### Massive Profits Wiped Out\n\nHeading into earnings, Tesla was the most profitable short trade of 2019 by a wide margin, scoring short sellers a $2.03 billion year-to-date mark-to-market profit. However, Tesla short sellers endured $1.4 billion in losses in early Thursday trading, according to S3 Partners analyst Ihor Dusaniwsky. He said Tesla short sellers saw 70% of their 2019 profits evaporate in a matter of minutes.\n\nThis year had been a rebound year for Tesla short sellers after they booked mark-to-market losses of $1.40 billion in 2018, $3.56 billion in 2017 and $400 million in 2016, according to Dusaniwsky.\n\nTesla is the second most heavily shorted U.S. equity with $8.31 billion in short interest. Only **Apple, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AAPL) has more short interest than Tesla at $10.47 billion in shares held short.\n\nFortunately for Tesla shorts, many of them locked in their profits prior to Thursday, with 5.12 million short shares covered since June. In the past week, S3 reported 1.5 million Tesla short shares have been covered ahead of earnings. Short interest now represents 23.1% of Tesla\'s public float.\n\n_See Also:  \'Game Changing\': Wall Street Weighs In On Tesla\'s Q3 Earnings _\n\n### Short Squeeze Coming?\n\nWhile Tesla shorts are feeling the pain, Dusaniwsky said a sustained push in the $300s for Tesla could trigger additional short covering.\n\n"If TSLA\'s stock price continues to climb we expect continued short covering to give the stock a short squeeze tailwind. If TSLA\'s stock price surge pushes the stock steadily into the $300 range we should see shares shorted fall below the 30 million share level. That would be over 2.6 million shares of buying from the short side helping push TSLA\'s stock price further into short squeeze territory," Dusaniwsky said.\n\nFollowing Thursday\'s gain, Tesla shares are now back above water for the past year, up 1.5% overall.\n\n### Benzinga\'s Take\n\nWhile the earnings report got Tesla back to where it was 12 months ago, a sustained push above $300 and a potential short squeeze may require at least one more impressive earnings report. Financial inconsistency has been one of the most common criticisms of Tesla in recent years, and it may take more than one earnings report to convert the skeptics.\n\nTesla\'s stock traded around $297.64 per share at time of publication.\n\n_Do you agree with this take? Emailfeedback@benzinga.com with your thoughts._\n\nWith nearly 200 hundred companies reporting earnings coupled with several after the bell on, the content for Thursday\'s PreMarket Prep was predetermined.\n\n### **Tesla Q3 Report Sends Bears Into Hibernation**\n\nAfter Wednesday\'s close, one of the most hated issues in the twittersphere,**Tesla Inc.** (NASDAQ:TSLA) shocked the Street with a huge third-quarter EPS beat. The company also announced trial production had begun in Shanghai and the company expects to make at least 360,000 deliveries this year.\n\nThe initial surge in the after-hours session took the issue to $308.52 before settling down into $300.00-$303.00 range by the beginning of this morning\'s broadcast. Based on the extended price discovery at that area, traders were encouraged to follow the breakout or breakdown of the consolidation phase.\n\nOff the open, it pierced the upper-end of that range rallying to $304.93 but not for long. Once it reversed course and penetrated the bottom end of that range ($300.00), it swooned to $289.20 before rebounding into the $290.00 handle.\n\n### **Microsoft Volatile After Q3 Beat**\n\n**Microsoft Corporation** (NASDAQ:MSFT) posted an EPS beat of 14 cents along with a sales beat of nearly $1 billion. Why the algos smacked it down over $3 from Wednesday\'s close ($137.24) was hard to figure out.\n\nWith the issue in the green in the pre-market session, we identified the $140.00 area as a potential area of resistance. The reason being, the issue had made two daily highs in that area over the last four sessions, perhaps being an institution(s) looking to exit a large stake in the company.\n\nThe issue did rally off its opening print and has cleared out the sellers at that area, so far reaching $140.42. If the issue can close above $140.00 it will be the first since Sept. 19, when it ended that session at $141.07.\n\n### **Twitter Crushed After Sales Miss, Weak Guidance**\n\nBefore today\'s open, **Twitter Inc.** (NYSE:TWTR) disappointed the Street with a third-quarter sales miss of over $50 million and fourth-quarter sales guidance much worse than expected.\n\nSellers pounced on the issue, taking it down in nearly a straight line from its close ($38.83) all the way to $30,82. Since that low was challenged on a few different occasions, $31.00 area and below was target for a potential long or a better area to cover a short.\n\nAfter a lower open, it once again went to test that area of support, but found buyers ahead of that low at $31.10. The subsequent rebound took the issue to $32.39 and is now trending down the lows for the session.\n\n### **CNN \'S Digital Correspondent Joins The Show**\n\nPaul LaMonica, CNN\'s digital correspondent joined the show about 20 minutes into the broadcast to comment on earnings season and the exaggerated price action following the reports.\n\nThe final quest for the week will be Raghee Horner, Forex and Currency Trading Expert for Simpler Forex.\n\nNew York startup Fabric raised $110 million in Series B funding for the U.S. expansion of its automated logistics platform for retailers.\n\nThe capital will "propel the company into a new stage of hypergrowth," the company said in an announcement on LinkedIn on October 23.

Here\'s a sampling of what analysts had to say.\n\n### New Era?\n\nWedbush analyst Daniel Ives said Tesla delivered a potentially "game changing" quarter that could mark the beginning of a new era of profitability and cash flow.\n\n"To this point, Tesla delivered a Picasso-like quarter last night with profitability and EBITDA approaching $900 million (Street was at $646 million) that speaks to a business model which has significantly lower costs, more production efficiency, and automotive gross margins approaching 23% which is extremely impressive on the heels of the lower margin Model 3 shift," Ives wrote in a note.\n\nLoup Ventures\' Gene Munster said Tesla\'s profitability is a reassurance that the company may finally be financially self-sustaining.\n\n"The trend in profitability is a measurable and potentially sustainable positive that could change the long-term trajectory of the Tesla story," Munster wrote.\n\n### Still Work To Do\n\nBank of America analyst John Murphy said positive cash flow and declining revenue makes Tesla nothing more than an expensive auto stock.\n\n"We would point out that OEMs in our coverage typically trade at about 3x EV/EBITDA or about 10x P/E through cycle, which in isolation implies a theoretical stock price of $28 on our revised 2020 estimates," Murphy wrote.\n\nCredit Suisse analyst Dan Levy said Tesla\'s quarter was certainly impressive, but the biggest question is whether or not it can be consistent.\n\n"Our take - a strong step forward, yet Tesla will need to put together a string of similar data points to demonstrate the sustainability of results…and its track record has been spotty on this," Levy wrote.\n\n### Ratings And Price Targets\n\n  * Bank of America has an Underperform rating and $235 target.\n  * Credit Suisse has an Underperform rating and $200 target.\n  * Wedbush has a Neutral rating and $270 target.\n\n\n\nTesla\'s stock traded higher by 16.7% to $297.26 per share at time of publication.\n\n### Benzinga\'s Take\n\nThere\'s very little to criticize about Tesla\'s third quarter. However, Tesla reported adjusted EPS of $1.93 in the fourth quarter of 2018 only to fall back into the red in the two quarters that followed. To truly silence the Wall Street critics, Tesla will need to prove it can be consistent and predictable.\n\n_Do you agree with this take?

That was the burning question seared into the brains of investors awaiting the electric car (and truck, lest we forget) maker\'s Q3 earnings report. \n\nThe answer, apparently, is yes it can. Tesla posted $1.91 adjusted profit per share on Wednesday, beating Wall Street estimates of $-0.24 per share.\n\nIts gross margin clocked in at 18.9%, versus estimates of 17.7% .\n\nIn its shareholder letter, the company said it expects "positive quarterly free cash flow going forward, with possible temporary exceptions."\n\nMarking a sour note, third quarter revenue declined, registering $6.30 billion, down from estimates of $6.42 billion and $6.35 billion in the second quarter of 2019.\n\nIn the letter, Tesla explained the losses: "Compared to the third quarter of 2018, the percentage of leased vehicles has tripled and alone has impacted revenue by the majority of the year-over-year decrease."\n\nRevenues for the third quarter of 2018 were $6.824 billion.\n\nThe results were a vindication for Musk, who has been much derided for not delivering on his financial promises - or vehicles.\n\nAnalysts\' naysayer estimates were based on a vehicle and production and delivery update earlier this month that missed Musk\'s internal goals. \n\nTesla delivered 79,600 Model 3 cars, and 17,400 of its higher-priced Model S and X vehicles during the third quarter. Musk had set a goal of 100,000 plus deliveries for the quarter.\n\nIn the letter, Tesla credited the rosier financial outlook to improved operating expenses, now at the lowest level since production of the Model started. Efficiencies included reductions in manufacturing and material costs and continued improvements in vehicle quality \n\nTesla also told shareholders construction on its new Model 3 factory in Shanghai is ahead of schedule, as is start-of-production for its crossover SUV at its main plant in Fremont, California. \n\nAfter missing several delivery targets, Tesla now says it expects to bring the Tesla Semi electric truck to production at the end of 2020.\n\nShares of Tesla rose as much as 12% in after-hours trading following the release.  \n\nAn earnings call is scheduled for 3:30 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time. Check back for updates.\n\nImage Sourced from Pixabay. Credit: Blomst\n\n**Tesla Inc**  (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock has been on a roll since late August, going up nearly 20%. And now it published its most important earnings results yet, with shares spiking as much as 17% after hours, reaching the highest price since February.\n\n### Surprise Profit!\n\nEveryone knows that this is a company with a market capitalization of $47 billion, and an enterprise value over $50 billion. But those valuations suggest the company will create billions in profits, not just sales and that\'s where the company had massive issues. Well, Musk finally made it during its third quarter, as by excluding certain items, Tesla reported earnings of $1.86 per share and this is far more than the 42 cent loss per share that Wall Street saw coming. Revenue came in at $6.30 billion, just shy of the $6.33 billion analysts had expected but then again, Tesla estimates have historically been exceptionally wrong. So, profits are finally in for the car maker that is driving the Electric Vehicle revolution! And this is the first profit since the last quarter of 2018.\n\n### Earnings Report\n\nWith revenues of $6.3 billion, Tesla generated a net income of $143 million. Sales are down slightly from the previous quarter, but also from the third quarter of 2018, with the company attributing the first year-over-year quarterly revenue decline since 2012 to the fact that the number of leasing customers tripled since they started this chapter with their Model 3 in April. So how did they make a profitable quarter? By slashing operating costs, which are at the lowest level since the production of this model started, helped by workforce cuts and the regulatory credits of $134 million.\n\nPast Tesla earnings reports haven\'t necessarily focused on the bottom line but on deliveries, with investors debating whether demand for the Model 3 would be sufficient to drive the growth that is bound to happen from the company\'s valuation. But in Wednesday\'s report, profitability was finally the center of attention. However, not even a loss in Q3 wouldn\'t be the end for Tesla stock due to potential for growth with its new factory in China. Wall Street has seen profitability coming eventually, analysts were just sceptic for this quarter.\n\n### Concerns\n\nTesla needs to convince the market that it can make real, consistent profit selling the Model 3 which is its main revenue catalyst, with tax credits for its buyers diminishing. Due to a slow start of 2019, Tesla has to pull off an even more impressive fourth quarter just to hit the low end of what Elon Musk estimates for the year that involve the company shipping at least 360,000 vehicles. Still, Tesla managed to make a profit for the first time since ending 2018 with back-to-back profitable quarters, finally making Musk\'s predictions come true.\n\n### Shanghai Factory\n\nTesla\'s Gigafactory 3 is the Joker for Musk\'s vision to become reality as it is going to change the game for the electric vehicle pioneer. US automakers are going to be subject to a 50% import tax whereas Tesla will be shielded from this burden. The factory will also give the company direct access to the largest electric vehicle market in the world. It is expected to start production this quarter, something that is not so common for Tesla.  Despite a recent drop of the economy, there are still plenty of opportunities for Tesla. Even with the sagging economy, Tesla will be able to sell more cars, period. But it didn\'t come easy, Musk spent years lobbying but the new factory seems to be well ahead of schedule already.\n\n### Competitors\n\nBMW (OTC:BMWYY) CEO is showing a strangely dismissive nature about Tesla and other upcoming rivals from its new CEO. It is a bit strange despite the company\'s history and strong legacy, considering that rivals offer more tech, range at a more reasonable cost when it comes to the electric market. Then there\'s Volkswagen\'s (OTC:VWAGY) electric ID3 that was recently revealed for Europe, taking passive safety further with a center airbag between the driver and the front passenger. But the automotive industry overall is struggling as even shares of Ford (NYSE:F) dropped almost 4% after the company posted a somewhat mixture in its third quarter earnings forcing it to cut its full year outlook and posted mixed earnings for its third quarter. And everyone expected further headwinds from China reflected in lower volumes and increased costs due to tariffs.\n\n### Outlook\n\nTesla still enjoys strong demand which is a good sign of the demand side. They just need to manage their costs and ensure their production runs smoothly, in other words, learn how to be profitable long-term. Optimists see Tesla as a bet on a brighter future being a company that will dominate the fast-growing electric vehicle space for years to come. On the other hand, pessimist point out to broken promises, and a valuation that fails to incorporate the realities of the difficult, low-margin, capital-intensive automotive manufacturing business. All investors\' eyes are now on seeing how much of a bust will the almost-ready Chinese factory make to Tesla\'s bottom line. Things may be finally looking up for the EV pioneer!\n\n**_This Publication is contributed by IAMNewswire.com_**\n\n_Press Releases - If you are looking for full Press release distribution contact:  press@iamnewswire.com_\n\n_Contributors - IAM Newswire accepts pitches.

 "The 40-day UAW strike that ended on Friday almost wiped out the **General Motors Company**  (NYSE:GM) free cash flow for the year and will end up costing the company $3.8 billion in full year earnings. But, the company's third quarter results easily beat up estimates despite the $1 billion strike cost for the quarter. This national strike was the longest in almost 50 years. As a consequence, the company has lowered its guidance for the year as the strike's cost was significantly higher than expected.\n\n### Third Quarter Results\n\nRevenue of $35.47 billion exceeded the forecasts of $33.82 billion resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $1.72 versus the expected $1.31. The strike has taken 52% per share of the company's earnings whereas the revaluation of its investment in **Lyft Inc  **(NASDAQ:LYFT) and warrants from PSA Group deducted an additional 15 cents per share.\n\n### Competition - Trump Administration's Side\n\nThe pressure posed by toughening emission standards has brought competitors together as GM unites with **Toyota Motor Co** (NYSE:TM) and **Fiat Chrysler Automobiles** (NYSE:FCAU) to back up Trump's administration in the battle with California's officials. The idea is to help themselves remain competitive as it would greatly ease their costs. Toyota just announced on Monday that it will boost its hybrid presence with its plant in Poland by 2022 due to increased interest in Europe.\n\nToyota and Fiat Chrysler are among the 3 automakers that constitute almost 30% of America's total vehicle sales but Fiat admitted it needs more electric cars and Toyota has doesn't yet have a serious electric car in the making, so the clock is ticking as the electric era is upon the industry. And this move has only led to critic of their leadership as siding with the government that allows the country to burn due to irresponsible environmental policies.\n\n### Competition: The Sustainable Side\n\nOn the other side of the emission argument, there are many automakers, such as **Honda Motor Corp Ltd  **(NYSE:HMC), **Volkswagen**(OTC:VWAGY) and **Ford Motor Co** (NYSE:F) who just issued safety recalls on 320,000 vehicles in North America, potentially resulting in $250 million in costs. The number 2. Detroit automaker reported strong third quarter results last Wednesday yet its stock plunged the next day due to reduced full-year guidelines as the company expects stronger headwinds in its last quarter of the fiscal year.\n\nBesides increased warranty costs, the company has to increase its spending in order to remain competitive and the Chinese market is taking much longer than expected to recover with total vehicle sales dropping 11.7% during the first nine months of the year. Ford has already started reducing its losses there which could improve its profitability and possibly even withdraw, considering the company lost $1 billion there last year. But, the latest decision of GM, Toyota and Fiat can only boost demand for these 'sustainability-oriented' companies, including the all-electric pioneer **Tesla Inc  **(NASDAQ:TSLA) who finally just reported its first profitable quarter.\n\n### Outlook\n\nThe strike ended with pay rises and bonuses along with other benefits for most workers so it is an overall 'draw' for the Detroit giant. But the good news is that GM shares have almost completely recovered from double digit declines during strike and they did beat estimates. The company is far from its pre-strike targets that were set in August when they reset their full-year guidance of $6.50 to $7 earnings per share. But perhaps the most shocking fact about this strike is that how little it mattered to U.S. citizens that almost 50,000 workers walked out of their jobs due to all the impeachment drama, so many Americans were unaware of GM's negative publicity.\n\nIt will probably trim the US' total GDP, and not just in the company's lost output, but through ripple effects in other industries such as auto-parts suppliers, airlines to communities where GM operates. But, the reputational damage of the company's leadership is what can do most harm, benefiting sustainable companies who are actually building an all-electric infrastructure to meet the near future.\n\n**_This Publication is contributed by IAMNewswire.com_**\n\n_Press Releases - If you are looking for full Press release distribution contact:  press@iamnewswire.com_\n\n_Contributors - IAM Newswire accepts pitches.

 'Billionaire investor Peter Thiel recently described his close friend and **Tesla Inc** (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk a "negative role model."\n\n### What He Said\n\nThiel was a participant in a debate on innovation at the UCLA\'s Internet50 event and argued in the positive, according to CNBC. Thiel emphasized young people don\'t strive to be like Musk because it\'s simply "too hard."\n\nMusk nearly single-handedly oversaw the development of both electric cars and reusable rockets, Thiel said on the stage. As such, aspiring entrepreneurs or creators are left saying they "can\'t do that."\n\nThiel and Musk have a history that dates back to the beginnings of **PayPal Holdings**(NASDAQ:PYPL).\n\n### Why It\'s Important\n\nInstead of innovating a new industry from scratch, it\'s much easier for a young person to "start a computer internet company" from their college dorm room, Thiel said. His comments are a likely reference to **Facebook, Inc.** (NASDAQ:FB), in which Thiel is an early investor and board member.\n\nMusk\'s innovation will likely continue inspiring his fans over the coming years, if not decades.
