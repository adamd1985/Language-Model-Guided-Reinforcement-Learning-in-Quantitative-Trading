=== Judge's Evaluation: TSLA - Market Data Until 2019-05-01 ===

Based on the provided market data and news, predict the LLM’s decision:
News Factors Considered:
['**Tesla Inc** (NASDAQ:TSLA) traded down Monday morning as investors took note of a couple updates over the three-day weekend.\n\n### **Boards Changes**\n\nOn Friday, Tesla announced it would restructure its board from 11 to nine members after former **Solarcity** CFO Brad Buss and Johnson Publishing CEO Linda Johnson Rice end their terms in June.\n\nThe firm will also hold a shareholder vote to cut director terms from three years to two. Venture capitalist Steve Jurvetson and private equity firm founder Antonio Gracias said they would not seek re-election to the board in 2020 if terms are reduced.\n\nAdditionally, management will propose changing vote procedures from a supermajority rule requiring approval from the owners of two-thirds shares to a simple majority.\n\n### **Explosion**\n\nTwo days after its announcement, Tesla was back in the news doing damage control. A video circulated showing a parked Model S bursting into flames in China. Management said it was investigating the incident with Chinese authorities.\n\n"We immediately sent a team on-site and we\'re supporting local authorities to establish the facts. From what we know now, no one was harmed," a Tesla spokesperson told CNN Business.\n\n### **Why It \'s Important**\n\nThe board reduction is intended to "streamline" oversight and let the body run "more nimbly and efficiently," Tesla said in an SEC filing. The board had added four members over the last five years and experienced "the duplication of certain areas of experience or expertise."\n\nSome consider the board shakeup critical to Tesla\'s growth -- and one taken just in time.\n\n"It strikes me as an important step towards more effective corporate governance," Stephen Diamond, associate professor of law at Santa Clara University, told Bloomberg. "I would call this a board shakeup. The trio of Buss, Gracias and Jurvetson are the heart of the Musk crowd and the old boy network. Maybe this will bring some fresh air and light into the board."\n\nNotably, only three independent directors will remain to keep a check on the mercurial CEO.\n\nIf investors liked Tesla\'s governance news, they were less keen to hear that yet another vehicle combusted. Chinese consumers on **Weibo** reacted to the report with outrage.\n\nTesla is in a precarious position as it attempts to expand in the massive Chinese market. With China accounting for 20 percent of annual revenues and Tesla eyeing market growth through a Shanghai plant investment, management can\'t afford to forfeit consumer confidence.\n\n### **What \'s Next**\n\nTesla will host Autonomy Day on Monday to highlight its Autopilot feature. It\'s expected to release first-quarter earnings on Wednesday.\n\nAt time of publication, Tesla\'s stock traded down 1.7 percent at $268.43 per share.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Morgan Stanley:\'Something Just Doesn\'t Add Up\' With Tesla_\n\n_Ives, Munster Like Tesla\'s New Board Members_\n\n### Top Upgrades\n\n  * Analysts at Raymond James upgraded **Rent-A-Center Inc** (NASDAQ:RCII) from Outperform to Strong Buy.

 'After a rough start to 2019, **Tesla Inc** (NASDAQ:TSLA) investors have a key fundamental catalyst on the horizon this week when the company reports its first-quarter earnings on Wednesday. Before the big numbers come out, Tesla traders should know the key technical levels to be watching in the stock\'s chart.\n\n### Technical Trends\n\nTesla shares have been caught in a bearish channel since the stock peaked in December at around $380. Since that time, Tesla has made a series of lower highs and lower lows, the hallmark of a bearish technical trend.\n\nTesla shares peaked in at $296 in early April and are currently trading in the middle of this bearish channel, with Tesla is near its lowest level of 2019. But despite a year-to-date decline of more than 20 percent, the stock has found support several times in the $260 area since mid-March.\n\nThe good news for Tesla investors is that a longer-term perspective on the chart reveals a much more neutral picture. Since early 2017, Tesla has been consolidating in a wide, volatile trading range between around $245 and $380.\n\nTesla failed to break out to new highs above $380 in June 2017, September 2017, August 2018 and December 2018. Each time a stock fails to break out above a resistance line, the resistance is strengthened.\n\nSupport in the $245 to $255 range has also been strengthened by multiple tests in April 2018, October 2018 and most recently in March.\n\nAt some point in coming weeks, something is going to have to give in Tesla\'s chart. The near-term bearish resistance line and the longer-term horizontal support line are pinching Tesla\'s share price into what technical traders call a descending triangle pattern. The descending triangle is typically considered a bearish pattern, usually eventually resulting in a breakdown below the support.\n\n### Key Levels\n\nRegardless of what the chart is saying, the fundamental news this week will likely trump any technical pressures in the near-term. More importantly, traders should see where shares are initially trading after the report comes out.\n\nIf the stock reacts positively, the first potential resistance level is the 50-day simple moving average at $285. If Tesla breaches $285 and continues above March highs of $295, it could be back on track for another test of $380 in the medium-term.\n\nIf the stock reacts negatively to earnings, the technical damage will be contained as long as Tesla stays above that long-term support level of $245. Below $245, there\'s a lot of air under the stock until it reaches the $175 to $185 range that served as support way back in late 2016.\n\nTesla\'s stock closed Tuesday at $263.90 per share.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Tesla \'s Weekend Starts With Board Shakeup, Ends With Car Explosion _\n\n__Short Sellers Earn $770M In Profit From Tesla Deliveries Miss__\n\nVisionary**Tesla, Inc.** (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk on Monday laid out an extremely optimistic timetable for Tesla\'s autonomous vehicle technology at the company\'s Autonomy Investor Day event. Unfortunately for Tesla investors, Wall Street wasn\'t particularly impressed by what Musk had to say, and the stock continued to trade near its 2019 lows on Tuesday morning.\n\nMusk said Tesla will have fully autonomous taxis on the roads by 2020 and will begin making cars with no steering wheels or gas pedals by 2021. He also said buying any other automobile other than a Tesla is "financially insane," and owning other vehicles "would be like owning a horse in three years."\n\nSeveral analysts weighed in on Tesla\'s AV update.\n\n### Impressive Technology\n\nSunTrust analyst William Stein is both hopeful and skeptical about Musk\'s claims.\n\n"Investors should recognize that, if the company achieves its autonomous driving goals, combining this with its already-achieved EV technology conspire to establish a ride hailing service that could be quite financially compelling to both the car owner and the rider," Stein wrote.\n\nCanaccord Genuity analyst Jed Dorsheimer said Musk is promising mind-blowing Level 5 autonomous capabilities within a year\'s time.\n\n"We continue to see Tesla as the clear leader in EVs, and if anything remotely close to the timeline for Level 5 capabilities that the company has laid out occurs, the formidable lead that the company has in autonomy will result in meaningful market share gains," Dorsheimer wrote.\n\nCanaccord Genuity has a Buy rating and $391 target on Tesla.\n\n### Shifting Focus From Q1\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said the impressive AV technology presentation was likely strategically positioned just ahead of earnings to remind investors to look beyond what could be a disappointing quarter.\n\n"We believe the autonomous day was meant to help the stock market focus on the multiple (strategic value) rather than the earnings (fundamental value)," Jonas wrote.\n\nMorgan Stanley has an Equal-Weight rating and $240 target.\n\nLoup Ventures\' Gene Munster feels more optimistic about Tesla\'s future following the AV presentation.\n\n"If you take Musk\'s comments at face value (which we don\'t recommend), the company could go from a loss of $1.3B in 2019 to over $300B in gross profit in 10 years," Munster wrote in a blog post.\n\nTesla\'s stock traded around $264.73 per share at time of publication after hitting an intraday low of $256.36. The company will release first-quarter earnings Wednesday afternoon.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Elon Musk Claims On Tesla\'s Autonomous Capabilities Does Not Reflect Its Current Reality_\n\n__Short Sellers Earn $770M In Profit From Tesla Deliveries Miss__\n\nElon Musk, the CEO of **Tesla Inc  **(NASDAQ:TSLA), while speaking at an invitation-only event for investors at the carmaker\'s headquarters in Palo Alto, California, claimed that Tesla is on the verge of introducing self-driving cars, hinting that it can happen as quickly as the end of this year. His usual flamboyant self, Musk said that it is "financially insane to buy anything other than a Tesla" and criticized the concept of LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) - the device that senses activity in a driving environment - saying it is a "fool\'s errand" to pursue that technology.\n\nMusk has had a long history of overpromising on Tesla\'s product capabilities, and reactions to the new claims have been met with skepticism as well. For one, trashing LIDAR, until now an integral part in the visual arsenal of a self-driving car, has not gone down well within the autonomous landscape, as virtually every frontrunner in the niche is using LIDAR to good success.\n\nMusk\'s insisted that Tesla\'s new microchip is objectively the best chip in the world, and that by mid-2020, Tesla\'s autonomous capabilities will have improved so much that drivers will no longer need to pay attention to the road. If this statement holds, Tesla\'s self-driving cars will meet the requirements of SAE Level 5 autonomy - a technology that can make a vehicle navigate without human help across all driving environments and situations.\n\nGoogle\'s Waymo and General Motors\' Cruise Automation are among the leaders in the self-driving space, and even with their sophistication and the thousands of hours their self-driving automobiles have clocked on the road, it is unsure if fully autonomous vehicles will  see widespread use in the near future. Though Waymo does offer rides to a limited number of test passengers in the Phoenix region, the cars always come with a human behind the wheel, ready to take control in case of an emergency or unforeseen situation.\n\nIn the present setup, what is feasible is for self-driving companies to deploy vehicles with Level 4 automation, in which the vehicle can make decisions in situations when human drivers do not respond in time. This could be done across geofenced locations like interstate highways where the possibilities of pedestrians and stray vehicles are more remote.\n\nLeaving aside the question of whether Level 5 automation is even possible, Musk\'s claims about Tesla having a self-driving car in just over a year look to be highly improbable on the current roadmap to driving autonomy.\n\nThe only thing in Tesla\'s favor is the number of cars it has sold across the world. This quarter, Tesla is expected to have a total of 500,000 cars on the road, from which the company collects driving data that is used to improve the predictability of Tesla\'s neural networks, helping steer the self-driving car. Nonetheless, it would all be pointless unless Tesla can prove without question that its cars can drive without help across every situation.\n\nMusk also stated that Tesla is looking to introduce robotaxis. "A year from now, we\'ll have over a million cars with full self-driving software," he said. Tesla\'s idea is to create a business model in the on-demand taxi hailing market that incumbents like Uber and Lyft envision - running self-driving taxis. Running automated taxis in the market would mean cutting out the taxi drivers - who comprise a huge percentage of taxi-hailing operations and costs. Automation will slash ride charges, giving the company that commercially deploys self-driving taxis a massive edge over its competitors.\n\nTesla plans to introduce an application wherein Tesla owners can opt-in on generating revenue by renting out their cars for the on-demand taxi market when they are not in personal use. Tesla is looking to take a cut of 20 to 25 percent per successful ride, which would significantly boost its revenue.\n\nMusk did casually admit that there might be a few "fender bender" situations, implying that people might get hit if conditions go awry. However, he was quick to acknowledge that Tesla would be held liable for any accident that happens on the road caused by a vehicle that is controlled by its autonomous driving system.\n\nAll this being said, Musk\'s tall predictions come right before its quarterly earnings report, which is expected to be below expectations as the company has had a disappointing few months of car sales. This has led Tesla\'s stock to sink 5 percent this week to $262.75 per share. Going by all of Musk\'s claims that have routinely failed to hold water, it remains to be seen if this announcement lives up to its promise, or if it will go down as yet another assertion not based on actual results.\n\nImage sourced from Google\n\nWant more content like this?

The mass of Teslas already on the road have been aiding in data collection used to enhance self-driving software.\n\nThe service won\'t be "in all jurisdictions, because we won\'t have regulatory approval everywhere, but I am confident we will have at least regulatory approval somewhere, literally next year," Musk said at the firm\'s Autonomy Investor Day.\n\nTesla\'s software powers an Autopilot feature enabling highway navigation and lane changes as well as the ability to summon a vehicle from a parking space. Engineers expect their cars to be able to function on city streets and to respond to stop signs and traffic lights later this year.\n\n### **Why It \'s Important**\n\nTesla\'s service would emerge not a moment too soon. **Lyft Inc** (NASDAQ:LYFT) and **Uber** have already primed the ride-sharing market and prepared commuters for a future without car ownership.\n\nWaymo began piloting its autonomous ride-share service last year, and **General Motors Company** (NYSE:GM) aims to launch its Cruise service some time this year.\n\n**Ford Motor Company**(NYSE:F) also began testing its competitor and set a 2021 target for widespread release. The project is being supported by a data-sharing partnership with Uber and Lyft. Notably, Ford shuttered its Chariot ride-share program earlier this year.\n\nMusk warned his timeline may be off, as it historically has been, but he assured his vision would eventually come to fruition.\n\nTesla releases its first-quarter earnings this Wednesday.\n\nTesla traded lower by 3.8 percent in Monday\'s session and was down about 1.4 percent Tuesday morning at $259 per share.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Needham: Tesla Nearing The End Of Its Growth Spurt_\n\n_Musk\'s DC-Baltimore Loop Tunnel Clears Regulatory Hurdle_'
 '**Tesla Inc** (NASDAQ:TSLA) missed top- and bottom-line Street estimates in its first-quarter report Wednesday. \n\nThe electric carmaker reported a first-quarter bottom-line loss of $2.90 per share on revenue of $4.541 billion, missing analyst expectations of a 69-cent loss on $5.44 billion in revenue. \n\nThe figures are an improvement over the first quarter of 2018, when Tesla posted a loss of $4.19 per share on revenue of $3.4 billion.\n\nModel 3 deliveries fell from 63,359 in the fourth quarter to 50,928. Model 3 production rose 545 percent on a year-over-year basis. \n\nTesla reported:\n\n  * Operating income of $521.8 million with a negative 11.5-percent operating margin; \n  * An end-of-quarter cash balance of $2.2 billion a 40-percent percent sequential decrease;\n  * Negative net cash from operating activites of $639.6 million; \n  * A 4.1-percent fall in auto GAAP gross margins; and\n  * A 13-percent quarter-over-quarter drop in energy storage revenue to $324.6 million. \n\n\n\n### Q2 Guidance\n\nTesla reaffirmed prior guidance of 360,000 to 400,000 vehicle deliveries this year.\n\n"If our Gigafactory Shanghai is able to reach volume production early in Q4 this year, we may be able to produce as many as 500,000 vehicles globally in 2019," the automaker said. "This is an aggressive schedule, but it is what we are targeting." \n\nTesla is targeting a 25-percent non-GAAP gross margin for Models S, X and 3. \n\nTesla shares were down 1.99 percent at $258.66 at the close Wednesday and were up 1.68 percent to $263 in after-hours trading at the time of publication.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Wall Street Weighs In On Tesla\'s Autonomy Day Presentation_\n\n_Tesla\'s Weekend Starts With Board Shakeup, Ends With Car Explosion_\n\n_Photo courtesy of Tesla.  _\n\n**Tesla Inc.  **(NASDAQ:TSLA) shifts into the earnings lane after the closing bell Wednesday with Q1 results that many analysts expect to be as inspiring as a flat tire\xad--and that\'s after a couple weeks of rough riding.\n\nTSLA started April with a stock price that had traversed an abnormally rocky road over the 52-week period, hitting highs and lows that jumped as much as $120 in between. On Tuesday, TSLA shares were trading in the $261 range, some 30% below their 52-week high of $376.79 in mid-December (see figure 1 below).\n\nThough analysts expect earnings and revenue to improve in Q1 from a year ago, they also project sharp sequential losses from Q4, in part due to Q1 deliveries and pricing projections both sliding off the road (see more below).\n\n### Tesla\'s News Cycle Has Been Busy\n\nWhy such a price variation? It could be because TSLA\'s messages have been mixed this quarter, according to most analysts covering the stock. They point to examples such as Chief Executive Elon Musk saying on a conference call with reporters Feb. 28 that he would close all the electric car company\'s dealers as part of a cost-cutting effort and only sell the cars online--a decision that was reversed 11 days later.\n\nLast week, TSLA announced a shakeup of its board--something some analysts thought could be tied to Musk\'s tussle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The company said that four board members will be stepping down over the next two years as the company shrinks the board.\n\nOn Monday, only two days before earnings were scheduled, TSLA held a press conference to announce that the era of self-driving cars is here. The company said it will have autonomous Teslas on the road by the end of the year, with a "robo-taxi" program by next year.\n\nThe news split Wall Street between skeptics and supporters on whether TSLA can make good on its ambitious plans. At the news conference, Musk made a sly reference to it: "The only criticism--it\'s a fair one--is that I\'m not on time. But I get it done."\n\nAlso on Monday, TSLA said it was sending a team to China to investigate a parking garage video that showed a fire apparently erupting under and around a parked Tesla. There\'s no indication that the Tesla car was the source of the fire or how it might have started, but the video appeared to catch investor attention.\n\n**FIGURE 1: ROCKY ROAD:**  Shares of Tesla (TSLA - candlestick) have seen plenty of volatility over the past 12 months. Curiously, shares have at times deviated significantly from the broader S&P 500 Index (SPX - purple line). Data source: S&P Dow Jones Indices, Nasdaq. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.\n\n### Is a Q1 Loss a Given?\n\nWall Street is bracing for a loss after two profitable quarters because TSLA shifted gears in February with a vague warning about the quarter. The statement came only a month after telling investors on the Q4 conference call that there would be a Q1 profit, albeit a small one.\n\nIn that Feb. 28 conference call to announce the $35,000 Model 3, Musk said, "We do not expect to be profitable in Q1, but we do expect to be profitable in Q2."\n\nOn April 3, TSLA said Q1 deliveries across all three models plunged 31% to 63,000 cars from Q4, which, coupled with pricing adjustments, would put a dent in Q1 net income. Shares tumbled 8% on the news.\n\n"Because of the lower-than-expected delivery volumes and several pricing adjustments, we expect Q1 net income to be negatively impacted," the company said then.\n\nPricing adjustments were necessary to make the cars more affordable, according to the company. On Jan. 1, prices for the vehicles effectively shot up with the cut in the federal tax credit that buyers of electric cars had received as purchase incentives. The credit is being phased out, starting with the 50% cut Jan. 1 to $3,750, falling to $1,875 after July 1 and ending next Jan. 1.\n\nWhat investors also might want to watch for is TSLA\'s cash on hand. TSLA ended 2018 with $3.7 billion in cash, but had to fork over nearly $1 billion in March to bondholders. TSLA said its cash reserve was "sufficient," but not all analysts seem convinced. Though the company is widely expected to report a loss, some see the potential for an upside surprise. Stay tuned.\n\n### TSLA Options Activity\n\nTSLA is expected to report an EPS loss of $0.69, compared to an EPS loss of $3.35 in the prior-year quarter, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates. It\'s important to note, however, that we use the term "consensus" loosely in the case of TSLA, as analyst estimates range from a loss of $2.81 per share to a gain of $1.18 per share.\n\nRevenue is projected at $5.4 billion, up 58% from $3.4 billion a year ago but down 25% from $7.2 billion in Q4. EPS in the last quarter was $1.93.\n\nOptions traders have priced in approximately a 6.6% stock price move in either direction around the upcoming earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move indicator on the thinkorswim platform. Implied volatility was at the 53rd percentile as of Wednesday morning. \n\nLooking at the April 26 weekly option expiration, put activity has been higher at the 250 and 260 strikes, while call activity has been concentrated at the 270 and 275 strikes.\n\nImage sourced from Pixabay\n\n_Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

The company scouted for a location in the state of Michigan and has finally zeroed in on Detroit, where it will partner with American Axle & Manufacturing to repurpose an existing manufacturing facility and bring back the jobs lost in the recent automotive industry slump in the region.\n\n"By choosing to establish its new facility in Detroit, Waymo is continuing the city\'s momentum and further cementing Michigan as a leader in mobility and the epicenter of advanced automotive manufacturing," said Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. "More and more Silicon Valley companies are looking to grow in Michigan as they realize the competitive advantages Michigan has to offer - high-tech engineering resources, top-notch research and design, and a highly skilled workforce matched with a low cost of living and low cost of doing business."\n\nWaymo has invested $13.6 million in the facility and is expected to bring close to 400 jobs to the region. The facility will speed up Waymo\'s bid to make autonomous vehicles a commercial reality, with the startup maintaining a comfortable lead in the market ahead of players like **General Motors Company  **(NYSE:GM), Uber and **Tesla Inc  **(NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nThat said, the autonomous driving space is fraught with competition as companies look towards gaining ground in the market, all with different approaches for profitability. On-demand cab hailing startups like Uber and Lyft have not turned a profit since their inception, and are now working hard to replace all their human-driven cabs with self-driving taxis. The idea is to cut the human element of its operations, thus driving up profit while maintaining aggressive pricing to gain market share.\n\nCompanies like Tesla and GM are betting on self-driving car technology because it will bring a new niche into their auto manufacturing segments. Tesla\'s CEO Elon Musk outlined his plans for introducing an autonomous taxi service, mentioning that he expects to see over a million Teslas with the self-driving software in them by 2020.\n\nWaymo currently runs its autonomous taxi service in Phoenix, Arizona, with rides offered to a couple of hundred people in the company\'s test group. Nonetheless, these taxis come with a human at the wheel, always standing by to take control in case of an emergency situation. But with considerable success in its pilot test runs, Waymo is now ready to take the first step towards making Level 4 autonomous cars a reality.\n\nMichigan is now witnessing a revival of its automobile industry through autonomous vehicle manufacturing. Apart from the new entrant Waymo, automakers **Ford Motor Company** (NYSE:F) and GM have already invested millions into mobility research and development across Detroit and Ann Arbor. One of the reasons for futuristic tech startups and spin-offs to move from Silicon Valley to Michigan is the relatively low cost of living and also the availability of skilled talent in the region.\n\nState policymakers have also been enthusiastic about autonomous driving technology. Michigan became the first state in the U.S. to pass regulations that allowed companies to test their self-driving cars on public roads. Michigan\'s Economic Development Corporation (EDC) has taken an interest in autonomous driving technology, approving up to $8 million in tax breaks for Waymo to set shop in the state.\n\nWaymo\'s new production facility provides space up to 200,000 square feet for its operations. The company announced plans last year to diversify its fleet by partnering with Jaguar, expecting to produce 20,000 vehicles by 2022. The startup also has contracts to buy 62,000 Pacifica Hybrids from **Fiat Chrysler Automobiles  **(NYSE:FCAU). Waymo has used Pacifica Hybrid vans over the last three years for its test runs across Arizona.\n\nImage Sourced From Facebook\n\nWant more content like this?

The R1T and R1S boast a range of 400 miles and are expected to sell for $68,000. The all-electric pick-up and SUV directly compete with **Tesla Inc**(NASDAQ:TSLA)\'s lineup.\n\n"As we continue in our transformation of Ford with new forms of intelligent vehicles and propulsion, this partnership with Rivian brings a fresh approach to both," Ford President and CEO Jim Hackett said in a press release. "At the same time, we believe Rivian can benefit from Ford\'s industrial expertise and resources."\n\nThe agreement is big news for Ford as it struggles to match pace with rival automakers.\n\nIn February, **General Motors Company**(NYSE:GM) was said to be in talks to invest in the electric-vehicle startup. Shortly after, Rivian announced a $700 million investment round led by **Amazon, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) but made no mention of GM.\n\nAs of yet, Rivian remains an independent company.\n\n### **What \'s Next**\n\nThe investment remains subject to regulatory approval.

 'Korea\'s largest global technology company, **Samsung Electronics Co Ltd**(OTC:SSNLF), has made a $2.9 million investment in cryptocurrency hardware company Ledger, according to a report by French magazine Capital.\n\nThe funding reportedly values Ledger at $290 million. Ledger is known for its hardware storage wallets, including the popular Ledger Nano S.\n\n**Samsung \'s Blockchain Push**\n\nEarlier this week, CoinDesk Korea reported that Samsung is developing its own blockchain network and exploring a potential launch of its own token, Samsung Coin. Samsung is also reportedly considering adding blockchain technology to its Samsung Pay digital payment app.\n\nIn February, Samsung announced that its latest smartphone, the Galaxy S10, would support cryptocurrency privacy key storage and blockchain-based digital signatures. Last month, Samsung unveiled its wallet, which will initially support Ethereum-based currencies but not bitcoin. The S10 also supports decentralized apps such as Enjin, Cosmee and CryptoKitties, according to CoinDesk.\n\n**Ledger \'s Wallets**\n\nLedger was founded in 2014 and now has more than 130 global employees. Ledger launched the Ledger Nano X cryptocurrency wallet earlier this year, the successor to its Nano S wallet. Ledger\'s higher-priced Nano Blue wallet has seen relatively limited success.\n\nLike the Nano S, the Nano X is a USB stick, but the Nano X is the first Ledger wallet to support Bluetooth connectivity. The Nano X also has a larger screen than its predecessor and can store more cryptocurrency assets.\n\nHardware cryptocurrency wallets provide an additional level of security for cryptocurrency investors concerned about potentially using a compromised computer. The wallets store crypto privacy keys and allow users to securely access currency by entering a simple PIN.\n\nLedger has reportedly sold 1.5 million units of the Nano S, which holds a maximum of four cryptocoins at the same time. The Nano X can hold up to 100 cryptocurrency assets. It also contains improved hardware that should help improve the speed of transactions. The Nano X starts at $119, nearly twice the price of the $64 Nano S.\n\n**Billionaire Backer**\n\nSamsung isn\'t the first high-profile investor that Ledger has landed. Last year, Tim Draper, venture capitalist and founder of Draper Associates, led a $75 million fundraising round for Ledger. Ledger reportedly said the fundraising round was "oversubscribed" and the largest Series B round of 2018, according to CCN.\n\nDraper, who was an early investor in companies like **Tesla, Inc.**(NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nHotmail and Skype, has long been a supporter of cryptocurrency. He also reportedly earned $89.1 million by investing in bitcoin starting back in 2014.\n\n"We are so excited about what Ledger does. It secures all your crypto assets, and you know I\'m a big fan of crypto assets," Draper said last year.\n\nDraper made headlines earlier this month when he said he expects cryptocurrency to ultimately disrupt fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar and help citizens around the world avoid centralized control. He will be discussing his views cryptocurrency and blockchain technology at the upcoming SALT Conference in Las Vegas starting on May 7.\n\nBitcoinExchangeGuide reported earlier this month that Draper will also be meeting with executives at **Facebook Inc.** (NASDAQ:FB) to discuss a potential investment in Facebook\'s Facebook Coin project. Facebook is reportedly seeking $1 billion in funding to support its stablecoin.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\nTim Draper Meeting With Facebook To Discuss Cryptocurrency Investment\n\nExperts: Bitcoin Will Take Down Gold, Fiat Currencies \n\n**Tesla Inc  **(NASDAQ:TSLA) badly missed analysts\' earnings estimates for the first quarter of 2019. The company reported an adjusted loss per share of $2.90, much worse than analysts\' estimated loss per share of $0.69.\n\nThe company also missed on revenue, posting $4.54 billion in comparison to the analyst estimate of $5.19 billion.\n\nEarlier this month, Tesla warned that its first quarter 2019 earnings results would be "negatively impacted" by lower than anticipated delivery volumes and price adjustments. The company\'s earnings release reemphasized this point.\n\n"Due to unforeseen challenges, we had only delivered half of the quarter\'s numbers 10 days before the end of the quarter," the report reads. "This caused a large number of vehicle deliveries to shift into the second quarter."\n\nThe electric vehicle company ended the first quarter with $2.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand, down $1.5 billion from the end of 2018.\n\nTesla Chief Financial Officer Zach Kirkhorn attributed the decrease to the payoff of a $920 million convertible bond, as well as an increase in the number of vehicles in transit to customers at the end of the quarter and the production and deliveries of Model 3 vehicles to overseas markets.\n\nInternational delivery complications and the large push at the end taxed the company\'s delivery operations, according to Kirkhorn.\n\n"We started production and deliveries of Model 3 vehicles for overseas markets during the first quarter. To quickly meet international demand, Europe and China Model 3 builds occurred in the first half of the quarter, with builds for local U.S. markets in the second half," the release reads. "This wave of quarter-end deliveries in the U.S., China and Europe meant that even short delays caused deliveries to be deferred to the second quarter. To improve our operations, cost efficiency and customer experience, we are in the process of balancing our regional vehicle builds throughout the quarter."\n\nTesla co-founder and CEO Elon Musk said he hopes to avoid a situation like the company experienced in the first quarter, when customers all over the world were receiving their cars at the same time. This stressed the company\'s resources and required them to pull employees from other departments just to get cars delivered.\n\nWhile the company\'s investor call focused heavily on consumer vehicles, Tesla President of Automotive Jerome Guillen spoke briefly about the Tesla Semi. He said the prototype of the electric semi was working "very well."\n\nGuillen said the company uses the semi "all the time,"  loading them to the maximum weight and even using them to deliver some Model 3s.\n\nHe said production on the semi will begin next year.\n\nTesla produced approximately 63,000 Model 3 vehicles in the first quarter, about 3 percent more than the previous quarter. The company attributed the subdued increase to changes to the production process for the introduction of new variants of Model 3, fewer working days and a supplier limitation.\n\nDuring the company\'s investor call, leaders said they did not anticipate supplier limitations to continue into the second quarter.\n\nThe company reported that the Model 3 was the best-selling premium car in the U.S. during the first quarter, outpacing the runner-up by about 60 percent. The earnings release attributed this partially to the fact that electric vehicles are priced lower than their gas-powered counterparts for the first time in history.\n\nDeliveries of Model S and Model X vehicles declined sharply, dropping to 12,100 vehicles from the company\'s two-year run rate of 25,000 deliveries per quarter.\n\n"This decline was mainly caused by weaker first quarter demand due to seasonality, pull-forward of sales into the fourth quarter of 2018 in the U.S. due to the first scheduled reduction of the federal electric vehicle tax credit in the first quarter of 2019 and discontinuation of our 75 kWh battery pack," the release reads. "We also had a mismatch between orders and deliverable cars. For example, due to adjustments in pricing mid-quarter, the take rate for the performance versions of Model S and Model X increased faster than we were able to supply."\n\nWhen analysts on the call expressed concern about demand for Tesla vehicles moving forward, Musk said demand for Model 3 vehicles, Model S vehicles and Model X vehicles is strong. He expects upgrades to Model S and Model X vehicles to result in a strong surge in demand.\n\nMusk said the company is seeing an uptick in demand, which he expects to continue as the company moves out of the seasonality of the first quarter, noting that people do not like buying cars in winter.\n\nWhen asked why he has not considered raising capital to support Tesla\'s growth, Musk was somewhat soft on the issue.\n\n"I don\'t think raising capital should be a substitute for making the company operate more effectively," Musk said. "At this point, I do think there is some merit to raising capital."\n\nWhen pushed to expound on whether or not investors should expect a capital raise from Tesla in the short- to medium-term, Musk repeated his answer, noting that it is "very important" for the company to create a solid foundation and exhibit financial discipline as it scales.\n\n"I do think there is some merit to raising capital at this point," he added again.\n\nImage sourced from Pixabay\n\nWant more content like this?

First-quarter revenue was $4.54 billion, missing expectations by 12.5 percent. Tesla previously reported 63,000 vehicle deliveries in the quarter, well below consensus estimates of 76,000 deliveries.\n\nSeveral analysts weighed in on Tesla\'s quarter. Here\'s a sampling of what they had to say.\n\n### Capital Raise Coming\n\nJPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman said disappointing first-quarter margins and cash flow increase the likelihood of negative earnings revisions from Wall Street and a capital raise from Tesla.\n\n"We expect a negative reaction after Tesla reported 1Q results that missed our expectations in several respects, including on margin and most importantly on free cash flow, while also introducing 2Q19 guidance that newly calls for a loss (vs. consensus which had expected a profit) despite assuming a large sequential increase in deliveries, implying continued margin softness after recent price cuts," Brinkman wrote in a note.\n\nBank of America analyst John Murphy said Tesla\'s operational issues are clearly far from over and he is expecting the company to continue to struggle to meet consensus estimates.\n\n"Based on our forecasts, we do not expect TSLA to turn the corner on free cash flow until after 2020, and, as such, forecast at least one sizeable capital raise before then to make ends meet, least of all to fund its ambitious growth plans," Murphy said.\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said Tesla will raise $2.5 billion in capital in the third quarter of 2019.\n\n"We think Tesla is waiting to demonstrate a recovery in demand and cash flow before looking to stabilize its balance sheet," Jonas wrote.\n\n### Unreliable Guidance\n\nDespite the weak quarter, CEO Elon Musk reiterated previous 2019 delivery guidance of between 360,000 and 400,000 vehicles, but Loup Ventures\' Gene Munster said investors would be wise not to trust those numbers at this point.\n\n"We are modeling for 341k which, while below the low end of guidance, still represents a healthy 39% delivery growth y/y," Munster wrote in a blog post.\n\nWedbush analyst and longtime Tesla bull Daniel Ives finally threw in the towel and downgraded Tesla, noting concerns over the company\'s demand outlook.\n\n"To this point, in our 20 years of covering tech stocks on the Street we view this quarter as one of top debacles we have ever seen while Musk & Co. in an episode out of the Twilight Zone act as if demand and profitability will magically return to the Tesla story," Ives wrote.\n\n### Ratings And Price Targets\n\n  * JPMorgan has an Underweight rating and $200 target.\n  * Morgan Stanley has a Hold rating and $240 target.\n  * Bank of America has an Underperform rating and $225 target.\n  * Wedbush has a Neutral rating and $275 target.\n\n\n\nAt time of publication, Tesla\'s stock traded down 2 percent at $253.28 per share.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Wedbush Calls Tesla \'s Q1 One Of The \'Top Debacles\' In 20 Years Of Covering Tech _\n\n_Technical Levels To Watch Ahead Of Tesla\'s Q1 Earnings _\n\nCompanies have been generally beating very low expectations during this corporate earnings season. That\'s probably why the market is near highs, but it doesn\'t seem like the S&P 500\'s (SPX) record close earlier in the week generated as much follow-through buying as might have been expected. \n\nWith stocks near all-time highs, investors and traders may not be sure how to proceed. But for now, volatility remains muted as investors continue to watch earnings season unfold.\n\nThis morning, index futures were mixed. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures took a beating after **3M Co** (NYSE:MMM) reported earnings and revenue that missed expectations, announced 2,000 layoffs, and cut its 2019 earnings forecast. But with MMM making up less of the overall mix of the S&P 500, futures for that index were faring better.\n\nAnd tech-heavy Nasdaq futures were doing the best of the big three index futures after solid earnings reports from **Facebook, Inc.** (NASDAQ:FB) and **Microsoft Corporation** (NASDAQ:MSFT). \n\nFB shares were up more than 8% in pre-market trading this morning after the social media giant reported better-than forecast revenue. The story certainly seems to have shifted from where the company was just a few months ago.\n\nFB said it had 1.56 billion daily active users and 2.38 billion monthly active users. Average revenue per user of $6.42 beat expectations. Facebook, Messenger, and WhatsApp Stories features now have 500 million daily active users. \n\nMeanwhile, MSFT reported earnings and revenue that beat analyst expectations, helped by sales in the company\'s cloud business, and **Tesla Inc.** (NASDAQ:TSLA) reported a much bigger loss than expected as revenue was less than forecast. \n\n### Market Takes a Breather \n\nMixed earnings reports and uncertainty at new highs didn\'t leave the market with reason to move higher Wednesday, and all three major U.S. indices ended the day in the red. Participants may also have been keeping some powder dry ahead of earnings from MSFT and FB and with **Amazon.com, Inc.**  (NASDAQ:AMZN) and **Intel Corporation** (NASDAQ:INTC) reporting Thursday.\n\nInvestors and traders may have been moving into bonds, as an index measuring German business morale unexpectedly fell. The decline in morale comes amid worries about slowing global growth as the U.S.-China trade war drags on. On that front, the White House said U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will head to Beijing for another round of negotiations to begin on April 30 and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will be in Washington for more talks to start on May 8.\n\nThe German data also pressured the euro, even as the dollar got some strength on support from stronger-than-expected new home sales data. \n\nNew home sales in March rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 692,000, when a Briefing.com consensus had expected a reading of 646,000. The housing market, which has been hamstrung by affordability issues, was helped by a decline in the median sales price and lower mortgage rates.\n\n### Mixed Earnings, Energy Keep Street Subdued\n\nThe housing data didn\'t seem to help stocks too much on Wednesday, as earnings were mixed and energy shares stumbled.\n\n**Caterpillar Inc** (NYSE:CAT) beat third-party analysts\' estimates on earnings and revenue and raised guidance, but its shares ended the day more than 3% lower. One of its executives warned the company could lose market share in China, comments that apparently outweighed the strong earnings. The company also reported higher costs that ate into margins. \n\nAlso, sometimes when you see a stock fall despite an earnings beat, it could mean a "whisper" number was out there that was even higher than the results. Or some investors might be discounting the better guidance because part of it is based on a tax benefit.\n\nIn a reverse image, **Boeing Co** \'s (NYSE:BA) shares gained slightly even though the aircraft manufacturer missed third-party estimates, pulled its earnings guidance, and stopped its share buyback program in the wake of the March crash of its 737 MAX, the second MAX crash in six months. BA said it would wait to post new guidance until it has more clarity on the aircraft\'s fate. \n\nThe slight rise in the company\'s shares could be because investors and traders were expecting bad news and there may have been some relief that the company\'s report wasn\'t worse than it was. \n\nIn a stock move that perhaps makes more sense on the surface, **AT &T Inc. **(NYSE:T) shares dropped more than 4% after the wireless carrier missed revenue expectations. \n\nIn sector news, energy was decidedly unenergetic Wednesday. With a 1.85% slump, it was the SPX\'s worst performing sector of the day. \n\nU.S. oil futures declined following a larger-than-expected jump in U.S. crude inventories. The Energy Information Administration said stockpiles rose 5.5 million barrels last week when, according to Reuters, analysts had expected a build of just 1.3 million barrels.\n\n**Figure 1:** The U.S. dollar gained ground Wednesday on surprisingly strong U.S. housing data and as the euro slipped on disappointing data about business morale in Germany.

Past performance does not guarantee future results_.  \n\n**Allocation Check** : The question now that the market is near all-time highs might be whether we start to see some investors take a little money off the table, especially considering the popular but not necessarily valid old saying, "Sell in May and go away." While past isn\'t necessarily prologue, the late spring and summer months have often been weak ones on Wall Street. On the other hand, the market has slowly been grinding up all year despite a hitch here and there, and some analysts seem to think this slow grind may still be the path of least resistance. As long-term investors often hear, it may be a good time to check allocations and make sure this surge in stocks since Jan. 1 hasn\'t put you into a top-heavy position in terms of equities vs. fixed income. Sticking with long-term plans and goals often can be a good policy, rather than getting carried away by too much enthusiasm.\n\n**Onward and Upward?** The S&P 500\'s new record close on Tuesday comes amid a bull market that isn\'t short on superlatives. "This 12th bull market since WWII is now being referred to as a \'Lake Wobegon Bull\' since it is above average in terms of magnitude, duration, valuation and accompanying GDP growth," investment research firm CFRA said. This bull market has gained 334% from its low on March 9, 2009, compared to the median rise of 94% for all bull markets since WWII, the firm said. It\'s also been the longest, lasting for 122 months versus a median 55 months, CFRA said. "History says that even though a digestion of recent gains is likely, relatively low interest rates and inflation, combined with improving EPS growth projections, point to additional new highs in the period ahead," CFRA said. \n\n**Pessimism Overdone?** One theme of this earnings season has been low expectations from analysts forecasting corporate earnings per share. But BMO Capital Markets thinks the 7% that analysts lowered Q1 EPS expectations in the three months leading up to the reporting period has been excessive. "These lowered expectations have reignited talks of an earnings recession yet again with many market pundits predicting a disappointing reporting period and a significant pullback in US stocks," a BMO note on Wednesday said. "However, we reject this notion, and instead see flattish to slightly negative EPS growth for Q1, and a return to positive growth in the forthcoming quarters as companies surprise to the upside."\n\n_Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

The firm\'s underperformance of already low expectations shook Wedbush\'s confidence.\n\n"To this point, in our 20 years of covering tech stocks on the Street we view this quarter as one of top debacles we have ever seen while Musk & Co. in an episode out of the Twilight Zone act as if demand and profitability will magically return to the Tesla story," Ives and Backe wrote.\n\nBy their calculations, management is not cutting costs aggressively enough to create a path to profitability. In fact, they forecast a near-term capital raise of at least $3 billion to sustain capex and pay debt.\n\n### **Price Action**\n\nAt time of publication, Tesla shares were set to open down 1.3 percent at $255.30.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Ford Beats GM To Invest $500M In Rivian, Enter Strategic Partnership On EVs_\n\n_Wall Street Weighs In On Tesla\'s Autonomy Day Presentation_\n\nSome of the stocks that may grab investor focus today are:\n\n  * Wall Street expects **3M Company** (NYSE:MMM) to report quarterly earnings at $2.49 per share on revenue of $8.04 billion before the opening bell. 3M shares fell 0.9 percent to $217.15 in after-hours trading.\n  * Analysts expect **Intel Corporation** (NASDAQ:INTC) to post quarterly earnings at $0.87 per share on revenue of $16.02 billion after the closing bell.

 '**Tesla Inc** (NASDAQ:TSLA) plans to increase its weekly Model 3 production rate to 7,000 vehicles by the end of 2019. It\'s not an inexpensive goal, but management\'s made a capital plan.\n\n### **Coming Up With Cash**\n\nAs it ramps production, Tesla expects cash generated from core operations to cover capital expenditures and pay off debt. The company concedes, however, that it may explore financing alternatives.\n\n"As always, we continually evaluate our capital expenditure needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital to fund the rapid growth of our business," according to the company\'s 10-Q filed Monday.\n\nOne such alternative may be to shift resources from energy investments to automotives. Tesla plans to halt research and development of SolarCity and record a $47-million impairment in the second quarter, according to the SEC filing.\n\nTesla remains engaged in stockholder lawsuits challenging the 2016 SolarCity purchase. How its write-off will affect the litigation remains unseen.\n\n### **Following Procedures**\n\nThe filing came days after CEO Elon Musk reached an agreement with the SEC to amend their settlement deal over social media announcements. The deal now specifies topics Musk cannot tweet about without prior approval from an "experienced securities lawyer." It does not propose fines or punishments for non-compliance.\n\nTesla\'s stock closed Friday\'s session at $235.14 per share and traded own marginally Monday morning.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_6 Months After Turning Bullish, Citron\'s Andrew Left Is Out Of Tesla_\n\n_What To Make Of Tesla\'s Brutal Quarter_']
