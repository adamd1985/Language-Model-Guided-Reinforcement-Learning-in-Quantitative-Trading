News Factors Considered:
['**Canopy Growth Corp** (NYSE:CGC) shares surged more than 4 percent after co-CEO Bruce Linton updated the company\'s fiscal 2020 revenue guidance Tuesday at the GMP Securities cannabis conference in Toronto. \n\n### What Happened\n\nCanopy anticipates at least $744 million in revenue in fiscal 2020, exceeding consensus analyst estimates by 19 percent, Linton said. The co-CEO said he does not expect Canopy to be profitable this year.\n\nIn addition, Canopy announced Tuesday that it has acquired Spanish cannabis producer Cafina in an all-cash deal.\n\n### Why It\'s Important\n\nCanopy stock is up 79 percent in the past year. In the most recent quarter, the company reported just $83 million in revenue and a 38-cent EPS loss.\n\nGiven the company\'s massive $14.5-billion market cap relative to the size of its business, the bull case for the stock assumes tremendous long-term growth. The company reported just $186 million in revenue in calendar 2018, so $744 million in 2019 revenue would represent exactly the type of growth investors are looking for.\n\nAt the cannabis conference on Tuesday, Linton said he\'s not concerned with profits at this point and said Canopy will continue to heavily invest in expanding its business.\n\n"If you have no idea what to spend your money on, then you can be profitable," Linton said.\n\nThe Cafina deal is a perfect example of Canopy\'s growth strategy. In addition to Cafina\'s 1,600-square-foot greenhouse, Canopy also has a 430,000-square-foot production facility in Denmark and an additional site in Germany.\n\n"Operating multiple production assets within Europe will allow us to increase revenue in the EU free of supply constraints," Canopy co-CEO Mark Zekulin said Tuesday.\n\n### What\'s Next\n\nInvestors will be watching closely for updates to Canopy\'s growth outlook, including additional buyouts and partnerships like Canopy\'s relationship with alcoholic beverage giant **Constellation Brands** (NYSE:STZ).\n\nDespite its lofty valuation, CNBC analyst Jim Cramer recently said Canopy is his top cannabis stock pick and could be the next **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\n"I think that Canopy could be the next Amazon because they\'ve got the capital and they\'ve got Constellation beer taking care of the liquids and they\'re doing the medical. I would like to see a big medical investment, but that hasn\'t happened yet," Cramer said.\n\nAfter a big 2018, Canopy is off to another hot start to 2019 as well. The stock is up another 58 percent year-to-date.\n\n_Related Links:/p > _\n\n_Wall Street\'s Favorite Cannabis Stock_\n\n_Where Will Tilray\'s Stock Find Technical Support?_'
 'Transport and logistics provider **XPO Logistics, Inc.** , (NYSE:XPO), apparently making good on commitments to buy back significant blocks of common stock at depressed prices, has in the past 60 days reduced its outstanding shares by 17 million or 15 percent - coming on the heels of an initial 17 million share buyback in early February, according to an analysis published Monday by investment firm Deutsche Bank.\n\nThe twin buybacks drop XPO\'s common shares outstanding to around 92.2 million from 127 million at the start of 2019, Deutsche Bank said. The first series of buybacks, executed around February 4, dropped the outstanding share count to 109 million. At that time, the company said its board had authorized funds for a second series, but that the company hadn\'t implemented the round as of then.\n\nAccording to Deutsche Bank, XPO executed the latest round of repurchases about 60 days from the completion of the first cycle. In the past two months, it has deployed more than $900 million to further decrease its share count, Deutsche Bank said. It based part of its analysis on an XPO filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission made today.\n\nIn December 2018, XPO Chairman and CEO Brad Jacobs said the company would forego acquisitions in favor of share buybacks that, with XPO\'s shares more than 50 percent off their all-time highs at the time, represented a more cost-effective use of its capital. All told, $2.5 billion had been authorized for the buybacks.\n\nXPO common shares, which traded as high as $116 per share in the fall of 2018, had fallen into the $50s amid a short-seller\'s report in mid-December that was very critical of the company\'s accounting practices, followed by disclosures in February that it would miss fourth quarter expectations after a major customer believed to be **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) would pull $600 million in business from XPO, or two-thirds of Amazon\'s annual business with the company. The latter disclosure forced XPO to lower its 2019 outlook.\n\nAmit Mehrotra, the Deutsche Bank analyst who prepared Monday\'s report, said it would be difficult to "find any instance where management has been so aggressive in seemingly capturing short-term dislocations in stock price for the benefit of long-term shareholders. XPO shareholders should also be heartened that Jacobs owns 20 million XPO shares. One long-term caveat, said Methrotra, is that all of the repurchases were made with debt.\n\nImage sourced from Pixabay\n\nWant more content like this?

(NASDAQ:NFLX) and **Amazon.com, Inc**. (NASDAQ:AMZN) quickly became ubiquitous. \n\nBut the AMC investor day last week served as a reminder that the good, old-fashioned movie theater is doing just fine, Miller said in a Monday note. (See the analyst\'s track record here.) \n\nCinema revenue has grown at an annual average rate of 2.4 percent since 1998 and at an even higher rate of 6 percent internationally, Miller said.\n\n"Further, against the notion that younger people do not go to the movies anymore, more teens and tweens are going to the theater than ever before, with 92 percent of AMC\'s paying guests between the ages of 12 and 24." \n\nAMC made a compelling case that people who stream a lot of movies also still go to the movies a lot, Miller the analyst said. \n\nGrowth in AMC\'s membership program has grown in 18 months from zero to 750,000 members, according to Imperial Capital. \n\n### Price Action\n\nDespite the positive note from Miller, AMC shares were falling by 2.8 percent to $15.60 at the time of publication Monday.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Cinemark Vs.

That\'s the view of veteran logistics analyst Steve Banker, vice president of supply chain services at ARC Advisory Group. Writing in Forbes, Banker said Uber vastly overstates the addressable market for Uber Freight, positions the unit as offering a unique digital-brokerage model when others are already doing it, and its "freight gross bookings," or freight under management, is dwarfed by at least four rivals. Uber Freight is hemorrhaging money and growth slowed in its last reporting quarter, Banker noted; investors in platform solutions can forgive the former, but are wary about the latter, he said. If this was a stand- alone prospectus for Uber Freight, and if the unit did not have the Uber name, "who would be foolish enough to invest in them," Banker wrote.\n\n## Did You Know?:\n\nThat 65percent of **Amazon.com Inc. \'**s (NASDAQ:AMZN) fulfillment and sorting center growth in 2018 and 2019 is located east of the Mississippi River, according to a Deutsche Bank report published last week analyzing secular shifts in middle-mile transportation.  \n\n## Quotable:\n\n"An important point to frame is that we are at historic levels in terms of the amount of non-U.S. capital coming into institutional quality commercial real estate."\n\nGunnar Branson, CEO of A Fellowship for International Real Estate (AFIRE), in an interview in National Real Estate Investor.\n\n## In other news:\n\n### Start-ups vie to lead India\'s logistics revolution\n\nWell-funded apps such as Rivigo aim to overhaul an inefficient logistics market that has hurt the broader Indian economy.

According to _Business Insider_ , Amazon has erected fabric tents - which it calls "delivery stations" - in at least eight states.

The tents are temporary until the company can find permanent structures, a spokesperson told the outlet. Marc Wulfraat, whose firm, MWPVL International, tracks Amazon\'s physical distribution efforts, said that most tents were erected in mid-size markets, and that the plan in some markets is to replace them with larger leased buildings. Pop-up structures have been used before, notably by UPS, Inc. to add delivery density during peak season.\n\nHammer down everyone!\n\nImage sourced from Pixabay\n\nWant more content like this?

CNS is an International Air Transport Association (IATA) company that serves the U.S. air cargo industry, but the conference promotes networking and pulls in many cargo leaders from Europe, Asia and Latin America as well. The theme chosen for this year\'s conference is the "e-Commerce Revolution." It\'s a new topic for the conference, but appropriate as the air cargo industry faces slower growth, declines in general cargo shipments, and criticisms about being slow to adapt and innovate to evolving customer needs.\n\nFreightWaves spoke with Michael (Mike) White, President of CNS and host of this year\'s conference, who pointed out that e-commerce is growing at twice the rate of domestic trade and "changing so many of the things we do" in air cargo. Boeing estimates that the global e-commerce market will grow 20 percent per year to $4.9 trillion in 2021. The FreightWaves SONAR index (RESL.ONLN) for electronic shopping and mail-order house sales tracks well and portrays this rapid U.S. e-commerce growth, averaging nearly 14 percent annually since 2014.   \n\nSONAR Ticker RESL.ONLN\n\nThe growth of e-commerce has created new complexities for the industry to tackle. Airlines have for many years successfully handled consolidated small parcel shipments from integrated carriers such as FedEx, UPS and DHL Express. E-commerce companies, which also act as third-party resellers, such as **Amazon.com, Inc**. (NASDAQ:AMZN), **Alibaba Group Holding Inc  **(NYSE:BABA) and others, are also using air carriers, either directly or through freight forwarders and express parcel firms. Beyond that, White noted the traditional boundary between freight shipments and mail shipments has been blurred, with e-commerce shipments moving in both channels. Freight forwarders and various postal entities now compete for the shipper\'s e-commerce business.\n\nOf the various air cargo industry challenges, White viewed the biggest challenge with e-commerce is defining how it fits into freight, and to manage the dynamics of e-commerce into the highly structured programs U.S. and foreign government regulators have around air cargo security, customs and compliance. The historical definition of who is the shipper and who is the owner of the cargo are changing with e-commerce. Apple\'s movement of production from China to India, moves by others to relocate manufacturing from China to Vietnam, Bangladesh or Indonesia, and even the pending United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) further globalizes the issue. More forwarders and airlines are starting e-commerce specialty departments, and niche third-party logistics specialists in destination markets are tapping into local e-commerce import demand, all driving new opportunities and needs for more industry solutions - and faster ones.\n\nSetting the overall tone for the meeting in opening plenary sessions on May 6 are three featured speakers. The first is Ruth Snowden, Executive Director of the Canadian International Freight Forwarders Association (CIFFA), who is leaving the industry and will provide a historical perspective and according to White, "very honest feedback on air cargo\'s challenges." Next is Dr. Peter Urlich, Vice President and Partner from IBM, who will provide a forward-looking view, addressing future technology, artificial intelligence and computer power. Following is Kenneth Furton, Provost and Executive Vice President of Florida International University (FIU), who will speak about educating the industry\'s employees of the future, different ways to train and new ways to teach.\n\nSOURCE: SHUTTERSTOCK / SMALL SMILES\n\nFollowing the plenary, the meeting will use an "Innovation Stage" concept pioneered at the conference last year, with a portion of the larger room partially partitioned off and set aside for presentations. This allows for broader uses of the conference area, including exhibits and networking among the over 600 participants already registered, the largest CNS conference to-date. Among topics to be addressed using this format include "The Effects of eCommerce on Customs," "Automating the Acceptance of Dangerous Goods," "Increasing Operational Efficiency in Air Cargo by AI and AR," "Economic Update - Future of eCommerce," "Need for Speed and Meeting Customer Expectations in the World of eCommerce" and "Customs and Security Challenges in the Fast-Growing eCommerce Sector."  In addition, there are other presentations using this format to discuss technology enhancements around payment collection and settlement processing, air cargo security, lithium battery detection and smart warehousing.\n\nTo address some of these large industry e-commerce challenges, senior representatives from the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) will have both speaking and panel roles. Other customer expectations around e-commerce such as expedited handling and tracking drive a need to reassess and redesign some of the traditional ways airlines, forwarders, cargo ground handlers and trucking companies have done business. Hopefully, putting all of these complex issues front and center in front of a large multi-industry group will not only educate, but also spark faster progress and drive real solutions to these challenges.\n\nAirlines, especially passenger airlines, have a continuous flow of economical cargo capacity available to meet the regular, expedited shipping needs of firms involved in e-commerce. With the air cargo industry recognizing its e-commerce gaps and tackling them as a group in this way, ultimately there should be a benefit for all stakeholders, including the shippers, third-party logistics providers and trucking companies that work with airlines and that are integral to serving the customer. It promises to be an interesting conference.\n\nImage sourced from Pixabay\n\nWant more content like this?

An HBR study showed that C-level executives could spend as much as 300,000 hours per year prepping for meetings, commuting to meetings, or attending meetings. Meetings are important to business communications, but an underlying thread in the business environment is that they are oftentimes a necessary evil that should be cut to a bare minimum.\n\n  \nIrrespective of whether you conduct your meetings the old-fashioned way in person or electronically over digital media, you\'ll observe that the art of scheduling meetings is a common problem for knowledge workers and often causes a drain on productivity.\n\n  \nThis piece provides insight into how Artificial Intelligence is coming to the rescue to help make meetings less of a hassle.\n\n****\n\nSource: HBR\n\n### The Statement of the Problem\n\nThe first problem associated with meetings is that there is no singular tool that simplifies that scheduling process. Counterparties in a meeting will first go through a back and forth via email or chat to agree on meeting times before using their scheduling tool to set up the meeting.\n\n  \nIn addition to a simplified scheduling process, users want a system that intelligently prevents double booking events in the same time slot. Lastly, users want a solution that analyzes how their time is spent so that they can intelligently make more productive use of their time.\n\n  \nGranted, some tools prioritize a simple interface for scheduling meetings; you may find another tool that does a decent job at preventing double-booking of events; and a few tools have AI capabilities to generate reports. However, nobody wants to use three different scheduling apps just to set up a meeting.\n\n  \nIn a typical one-hour meeting, about 10 minutes will be spent on chit-chat, getting all counterparties on the table, and confirming that someone is taking notes. By the time you factor in setup and glitches from audio-visual equipment, a great deal of the hour won\'t have delivered productive value to the company.\n\n****\n\n### Artificial Intelligence is the Future of Scheduling\n\n**Calendar**  \nCalendar is leveraging artificial intelligence to help organizations distill more productive value from their meetings. Calendar is positioned as a foundational tool for smart time management personally and at work. Calendar is already being called the ultimate productivity tool because it drastically cuts down the time you spend scheduling meetings so that you can focus on your core competencies.\n\n  \nFor instance, the smart scheduling and smart suggestion features of Calendar eliminates the hassles that come with scheduling meetings by locating the free times in you day and providing suggestions on how best to leverage them. The AI engine that powers Calendar is also designed to become smarter the more you use it; hence, it eventually becomes intuitive to develop a uniquely tailored experience for you around your frequent meetings, locations, participants, and durations with one-click schedules, time-zone recognition, and multi-person scheduling among others.\n\n  \nCalendar is designed to evolve as your needs change; hence, it delivers seamless integration with **Google  **(NASDAQ:GOOG), **Microsoft Corporation  **(NASDAQ:MSFT), and **Apple Inc.  **(NASDAQ:AAPL) platforms to deliver a unified calendar view across multiple devices and platforms.\n\n  \n**Alexa**  \nLast year **Amazon.com, Inc.  **(NASDAQ:AMZN) revealed a new feature as part of its Alexa for Business suite of products called Alexa Smart Scheduling Assistant. The new feature allows people to schedule one-on-one meetings and to transition between work and personal calendars using voice controls. A statement from Muthu Somasundaram who works in Product Marketing at AWS notes that "Alexa Smart Scheduling Assistant expands on Alexa\'s calendar management capabilities that currently include browsing the calendar, creating new events, and canceling appointments."\n\n  \nAmazon\'s foray into smart scheduling highlights the role that AI can play in providing tools and resources for organizations to automate processes, increase the efficiency of their systems, and boost the productivity of their workers.\n\n  \nAI when deployed in scheduling can unlock more productivity by finding time the schedules of participants in a meeting, manage the responses of attendees, and provide valuable reports for planning for productive meetings.\n\n### The true cost of scheduling to business\n\nAccording to Doodle\'s 2019 State of Meetings report, the cost of poorly organized meetings in 2019 will reach $399 billion in the U.S. and $58 billion in the U.K.\n\n  \nAccording to an infographic from Atlassian, the average person spends 31 hours attending meetings every month; for context, that means the average person will have 30-minute meetings about 62 times every month.\n\n  \nIf your management team has 8 people who receive an annual salary of $100,000 per person and each one of them spends 15 hours per week attending meetings, your annual cost on the meetings alone will be more than $200,000.\n\n  \nAI-powered tools such as Calendar and Alexa for business will birth a new era is smart meeting scheduling and make it easier for teams and businesses to reduce time wastage and to unlock more productivity.\n\nImage sourced from Pixabay\n\nAfter returning from a long weekend, investors and traders appear to be gearing up for a busy week on the earnings front as they continue awaiting a potential trade deal between the United States and China.\n\nIn general, earnings season is turning out to be better than analysts expected, although many had low expectations. As of Thursday, Reuters reported that nearly 80% of the 77 S&P 500 (SPX) companies that had reported results have beaten consensus. Still, SPX profits are expected to have fallen 1.7% year-over-year for the January-March reporting period, the news agency reported.\n\nIn commodities markets, oil prices hit their highest point this year on expectations that the United States will announce the end to sanctions waivers for buyers of Iranian oil. The move would come at a time when supplies have already been tightening because of sanctions on Iran and Venezuela, as well as OPEC-led cuts. The surge in oil prices is helping support the Canadian dollar. \n\nThe earnings season continued Monday with **Halliburton Company  **(NYSE:HAL) and **Kimberly-Clark Corp** (NYSE:KMB) reporting better-than-forecast earnings and revenue. Companies also reporting this week include **The Coca-Cola Co** (NYSE:KO), **United Technologies Corporation** (NYSE:UTX), **Microsoft Corporation  **(NASDAQ:MSFT), **Exxon Mobil Corporation** (NYSE:XOM), **Facebook Inc  **(NASDAQ:FB), **Amazon.com, Inc.  **(NASDAQ:AMZN), and **Twitter Inc  **(NYSE:TWTR).\n\nOne report that is likely to be closely watched this week is that of **Boeing Co  **(NYSE:BA). Investors likely are waiting for BA to provide more clarity on aircraft orders and production after the crashes of two 737 Max aircraft put the program under close scrutiny. \n\nThe fleet of Max aircraft is grounded and some airlines have talked about cancelling future orders. Investors could have a lot of questions for BA on how that might affect the company\'s financial picture for the rest of 2019. Maybe the biggest thing to consider regarding BA earnings is how these cancellations may have affected its order flow. \n\nEconomic data expected this week include new home sales, durable goods orders, and the final April reading for the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index. Perhaps the most highly anticipated report comes on Friday with the government\'s first estimate for Q1 gross domestic product. (See more on GDP below.)\n\n### Industrials Shine\n\nThe three main U.S. indices finished in the green Thursday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq (COMP) just barely scraping out a positive finish and the SPX and Dow Jones Industrial Average up more strongly. \n\nThe Industrials sector made up the day\'s biggest winner, rising more than 1.1% amid positive earnings reports, including from **Honeywell International Inc  **(NYSE:HON), **Union Pacific Corporation**  (NYSE:UNP) and **United Rentals, Inc.** (NYSE:URI).\n\nThe sector may have also gotten some help after China\'s commerce ministry said there has been progress in working out the text of a U.S.-China trade deal. Among other Industrials companies, shares of Caterpillar (CAT) and BA were up slightly. \n\nBecause of their exposure to China the two companies are often seen as proxy trades for the ups and downs of the negotiations between the world\'s two largest economies as they work to end a trade war that has weighed on Wall Street for months amid worries about global economic growth.\n\n### Economic Data Also Help\n\nThe market also got a lift on Thursday from economic data that added to a picture of a U.S. economy that, while not going gangbusters, is still showing signs of health.\n\nU.S. retail sales for March came in stronger than forecast, notching a 1.6% gain when a Briefing.com consensus showed expectations of a 0.9% rise. Anything pointing to the health of the American consumer can be particularly important given the huge percentage of gross domestic product that is driven by consumer spending. \n\nIn other economic data, initial U.S. jobless claims hit their lowest level since 1969, coming in at 192,000 compared to a Briefing.com consensus forecast of 208,000.\n\n**Figure 1: RELATIVE CALM?:  **Though the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) starts the week with a pop above the 13-handle, the fear index has been drifting lower in recent weeks, and is quite subdued by historical standards. A lot of fear seems to have left the market after the Fed\'s dovish pivot and amid optimism on a U.S.-China trade deal. But the VIX declines recently are especially notable as trading volumes have been low. Thin volume tends to exacerbate market volatility not subdue it. Data Source: Cboe Global Markets. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. _For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results_.    \n**Healthcare Checkup** : Somewhat surprisingly, Thursday\'s best performer in the $DJI was **UnitedHealth Group Inc  **(NYSE:UNH). The company, as well as the Healthcare sector, has been under pressure recently amid worries about potential legislative changes out of Washington that could affect the industry.The concerns ratcheted up after UNH\'s CEO spoke against "Medicare for All" in a UNH earnings conference call and said healthcare price inflation has been slowing. Perhaps the bounce on Thursday came as some investors and traders might have been thinking the stock had gotten low enough to offer an attractive buying opportunity. UNH shares finished more than 2.2% higher while the Healthcare sector in general gained 0.14%.\n\n**Waiting for GDP** : The Bureau of Economic Analysis is scheduled to take its first crack at Q1 GDP this week, and a Briefing.com consensus forecasts a reading of 1.9% annualized growth. Prior to that release, investors can turn to the Atlanta Fed\'s GDPNow model for GDP estimates. The latest forecast, from Friday, showed estimated real seasonally adjusted annualized GDP growth of 2.8%. If the actual GDP forecast comes in that strong, which would be well ahead of the Briefing.com consensus, then the stock market could react positively, especially with inflation muted at the moment. The next GDPNow update is scheduled for Thursday, a day ahead of the government report. \n\n**A Look at Housing** : With the market closed last Friday, investors could be forgiven for not noticing some housing market data that came out that day. Annualized numbers for housing starts and building permits for March came in below expectations, with 1.139 million starts and 1.269 million permits compared to Briefing.com consensus estimates of 1.247 million starts and 1.3 million permits. "Single-family starts and single-family permits both declined month-over-month in March and were down noticeably year-over-year, suggesting the likelihood of ongoing supply constraints at more affordable price points unless more affordable existing home inventory comes on the market," Briefing.com said.\n\n_Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

 'The garage is about to become the largest parcel locker in America.\n\nE-tailer **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Chamberlain Group, the maker of garage door openers and remote control devices, announced a joint venture to give Amazon delivery drivers access to residences by opening the garage door and placing packages inside it. The initiative is Amazon\'s latest effort to service consumers who aren\'t home to accept deliveries and who don\'t want packages left outside the property.\n\nDeliveries can be executed either with a WiFi-capable garage door, or with an "In-Garage Kit" that can be installed. Consumers who already have a WiFi-enabled door can use the service by connecting Amazon and Chamberlain accounts in the digital app of "Amazon Key," which manages the operation. Those opting for the kit installation can access the service through a digital hub that connects a standard garage door opener to the cloud, a special opener from Chamberlain, or either of the two services in conjunction with an Amazon "Cloud Cam" that provides live feeds and motion clips at the delivery location. The "Key App" allows users to check the status of their garage doors, and open and close it regardless of location, according to Amazon.\n\nAmazon customers wanting "in-garage" delivery will check the button at checkout on the company\'s site. On the day of delivery, the customer will be given a time window for the driver\'s arrival. The customer will again be notified as the driver approaches the location. Using a hand-held device, the driver will request to open the garage door. The door opens, the driver places the packages in the garage, then requests the door be closed and locked. After the Amazon system verifies the package has been delivered to the proper address, the consumer will receive a final notification. A Cloud Cam will allow the consumer to view a video clip of the delivery.\n\nThe "Key" app enables Amazon drivers to gain access to customers\' homes - which include garages - their cars and business locations to deliver packages if no one is there to receive them.\n\nThat may help solve the problem that homeowners and townhome owners often face - not wanting packages left outside their homes in public view. With Amazon\'s new service, homeowners will not have to stay home from work to ensure they are there to accept a shipment.\n\nImage sourced from Pixabay\n\nWant more content like this?

Now, the two are duking it out in cloud computing. \n\nMicrosoft is scheduled to report fiscal Q3 earnings after the close Wednesday, with Amazon expected to report Q1 earnings after the close Thursday.\n\nAs a reminder, cloud computing provides a way for businesses to access servers, storage, databases and application services over the Internet. A company like AMZN or MSFT owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these services, while their business customers can use what they need through the web without having to build or buy expensive hardware platforms.\n\nAs the two companies\' cloud businesses grow, they\'re touting partnerships and expanding their reach even to competitors in an effort to climb to the top.\n\nFor instance, earlier this year, MSFT announced a partnership with **Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.** (NASDAQ:WBA) to develop new health care delivery models and for WBA to migrate most of its infrastructure into MSFT\'s Azure cloud. This followed similar announcements by MSFT of deals with **Kroger Co  **(NYSE:KR) and **Walmart Inc  **(NYSE:WMT). The interesting thing, as research firm CFRA notes, is that all three of those companies are also competitors of cloud leader AMZN.\n\nAt the same time, Amazon counts one of its own biggest competitors--**Apple Inc  **(NASDAQ:AAPL)--as a major customer for its cloud platform, with CNBC reporting this week that AAPL is spending more than $30 million a month on Amazon\'s cloud even as AAPL invests to build its own data storage. With AAPL customers using one billion devices a month, AAPL has vast storage requirements, and AMZN\'s cloud might be one beneficiary even though the two are rivals in other business areas.\n\nGetting back to MSFT, total commercial cloud revenues rose 48% in Q2 to $9 billion while Azure revenues rose 76%. Azure growth was also 76% in Q1. The Q2 Azure growth was nothing to sneeze at, but the same as the previous quarter. Now we\'ll see how things went in the first few months of 2019 at a time when corporate capital expenditures appeared to soften, according to the Fed and recent economic. data. \n\nOne question is whether cloud growth in the company\'s fiscal Q2 got hurt by the slowing global economy and may have bounced back in fiscal Q3. Shares of MSFT are up sharply so far this year, perhaps a sign that investors are optimistic that\'s the case.\n\nOver at Amazon, revenue from Amazon\'s cloud platform Amazon Web Services rose 45% to $7.43 billion in Q4 and represented about 10% of the company\'s total quarterly revenue. Like MSFT, the company could conceivably be dealing with slower capital expenditures from customers, and both MSFT and AMZN faced a stronger dollar in early 2019 vs. a year ago that might have slowed sales to overseas customers.  \n  \n**Figure 1: HEADS IN THE CLOUD:** It\'s been a quick elevator ride higher for shares of Amazon (AMZN - candlestick) and Microsoft (MSFT - purple line) so far in 2019, as this year-to-date chart shows. The question going into their earnings reports this week is whether the market\'s optimism will be repaid with strong cloud growth for the two companies. Data Source: Nasdaq. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.  \n\n### Beyond the Cloud\n\nThat said, analysts are expecting big things from both AMZN and MSFT, and that goes beyond cloud computing. Since MSFT started out as a personal computer software firm and Amazon started out as an online goods seller, those categories still play big roles in both their businesses. There\'s optimism on Wall Street about MSFT\'s Microsoft Office platform and Amazon\'s impressive operating income gains. A healthy U.S. consumer could potentially help lift Amazon\'s online retail and Whole Foods businesses.\n\nHowever, Amazon Prime growth appears to be slowing, according to market research firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. That\'s possibly troubling because Prime members tend to spend more at Amazon than non-Prime members.\n\nMeanwhile, over at MSFT, there was some sequential revenue growth slowdown in both Productivity and Business Products and More Personal Computing segments from fiscal Q1 to Q2. Trends in those businesses--which include Office Commercial and Windows Commercial products--could be something to consider checking in fiscal Q3.\n\nLooking back guidance for Q1, AMZN said net sales are expected to be between $56 billion and $60 billion, or to grow between 10% and 18% compared with Q1 2018. The revenue guidance was a bit lower than some on Wall Street had expected, and some analysts called it downbeat. Amazon also talked about possibly increasing its spending growth in 2019, which could potentially weigh on profits.\n\nMSFT, whose Q2 revenue came in slightly below third-party consensus expectations, also shared revenue guidance that just missed the Street\'s thoughts. Microsoft said then it expects fiscal Q3 revenue of between $29.4 billion and $30.1 billion. The midpoint of that range was just under the average analyst estimate when MSFT released the guidance. \n\nOne thing to consider closely watching is MSFT\'s revenue growth, which slipped from fiscal Q1 to fiscal Q2. It rose 12% year-over-year in Q2. \n\nAnd for anyone keeping score, MSFT enters earnings just ahead of AMZN in the battle for second place in total market capitalization (AAPL is back in the lead). As of the start of this week, MSFT had a market cap of around $950 billion, with AMZN at $922 billion. AAPL remains in sight of both at $965 billion.\n\n### Microsoft Earnings and Options Activity\n\nWhen MSFT releases results, it is expected to report adjusted EPS of $1, up from $0.95 in the prior-year quarter, on revenue of $29.84 billion, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates. That revenue would represent 11.3% growth from a year ago. \n\nOptions traders have priced in approximately a 2.8% stock price move in either direction around the upcoming earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move indicator on the thinkorswim® platform. Implied volatility was at the 21st percentile as of this morning. \n\nLooking at the April 26 weekly option expiration, call volume has been active at the 124 and 125 strikes, but the most active strike by far has been the 126 calls. Put volume has been active at the 120 and 123 strikes.\n\n### Amazon Earnings and Options Activity\n\nWhen AMZN releases results, it is expected to report adjusted EPS of $4.72, up from $3.27 in the prior-year quarter, on revenue of $59.65 billion, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates. That revenue would represent 16.9% growth from a year ago.\n\nOptions traders have priced in approximately a 3.5% stock price move in either direction around the upcoming earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move indicator on the thinkorswim® platform. Implied volatility was at the 34th percentile as of this morning. \n\nLooking at the April 26 weekly options expiration, call volume was pretty light overall but heaviest at the 1900 strike. Put volume was also light, but heaviest at the 1850 and 1860 strikes.\n\n_Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) has changed the retail business. It has changed the cloud computing business. It has also changed the supply chain business, but perhaps not in the way that you think.\n\nOn April 9, 2015, Amazon published a blog post on the AWS Blog - "Introducing Amazon Machine Learning." In the time since, sophisticated artificial intelligence capabilities and tools that make it easy for non-experts to deploy powerful models to solve business problems that were intractable until now have become part of Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and other public cloud computing services. According to a 2018 report by Stratistics MRC, the market for Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 41.2 percent, moving from $679.32 million to $7.62 billion between 2016 and 2023.\n\n**Why does this matter?**\n\nFor the first time, technology startups building innovations that rely on supply chain data can utilize and deploy sophisticated Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Speech Recognition, Computational Learning and Real-time Simulation at a fraction of the cost it used to require just to get started.\n\nConcurrently, advances in microprocessor technology have led to a scenario in which data can be collected, analyzed and used to make critical decisions at the point of use - even in situations where poor internet connectivity makes communication between edge devices and public cloud services impossible, at relatively minimal cost. The graph below shows the growth in the number of connected devices globally, from 15 billion in 2015 to an estimated 75 billion in 2025.\n\nSource: IHS/statista\n\nBefore 2015 logistics network optimization was only possible for the largest, most sophisticated companies. Since 2015, that has changed. Supply chain logistics networks can now be optimized in real-time, based on proprietary and non-proprietary data, and used to render a decision in a fraction of the time, and at a fraction of the cost it would previously have taken.\n\nThis development has led to the beginning of a new era in supply chain management. We are moving out of the age of transactional supply chain management and into the age of cognitive supply chain management. Transactional supply chains are characterized by: a narrow focus on discrete tasks that optimizes processes rather than end-to-end outcomes; static and siloed data that is refreshed at relatively long intervals; local optimization that does not account for global conditions throughout the supply chain network; and reactive decision-making that is also relatively slow. In contrast, cognitive supply chains are characterized by: a focus on optimizing end-to-end outcomes within the supply chain network; data that is dynamic, refreshed in real-time and collaborative; global optimization; and adaptive decision-making that accounts for the cadence at which business operations occur.\n\n**Why is this significant?**\n\nManufacturing added $2.38 trillion to the U.S. economy in the fourth quarter of 2018 (durable goods manufacturing contributed $1.33 trillion while non-durable goods contributed $1.05 trillion). Transportation and warehousing added $664.4 billion to the U.S. economy in the fourth quarter of 2018. The U.S. gross domestic product was $20.87 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2018. Manufacturing, transportation and warehousing represent approximately 15 percent of total U.S. economic output. (Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis)\n\nOf the 251,774 manufacturing firms in the U.S. as of 2015, 98.5 percent have fewer than 500 employees and are considered small. (Source: National Association of Manufacturers. Author\'s calculations.) This is the opportunity; the portion of that population that is big enough to purchase supply chain network optimization software, but too small to build its own.\n\nAccording to "How Online Marketplaces Can Power Employment in Africa," a BCG report, "The cost of getting a product from the factory to an end user within Europe adds around 90 percent to that product\'s manufacturing cost. In Africa, logistics adds an average of 320 percent to a manufactured good\'s cost." Consider the implications of supply chain network optimization in all regions of the world.\n\nThe opportunity is even more exciting when one realizes that manufacturing is only one of the sectors in which this transformation is taking place. Every aspect of economic production and consumption will be affected by this shift from transactional to cognitive supply chains.\n\nThis is why startups building new supply chain logistics software have captured the imagination of venture capitalists recently, leading to the 25x growth in the amount of capital that venture capitalists are deploying in freight tech startups. Some of them are building proprietary products that they use to run their own captive businesses. Others are building platforms that enable their customers\' businesses. That distinction is less exciting than the possibilities this ongoing transition offers investors and entrepreneurs.\n\nImage sourced from Pixabay\n\nWant more content like this?

And he\'s paying for it as a way of thanking them for helping make him successful.\n\n### **What He Did**\n\nLots of quarterbacks give gifts to their offensive linemen, the guys who toil, mostly in anonymity and for much lower pay, to protect the QB from getting sacked. But rather than something flashy, Wilson is going with a practical gift with an eye toward long-term benefit.\n\nWilson, who recently became the highest-paid NFL player with a four-year $140 million deal with the Seahawks, gave each of his 13 offensive linemen $12,000 in Amazon stock, TMZ reported Monday.\n\n### **Why It \'s Important**\n\n"You sacrifice your physical and mental well-being to protect me, which in turn allows me to provide and care for my family," Wilson said in a letter to his O-line. "This does not go unnoticed and it is never forgotten…. The memories on the field will last forever, but we have to constantly prepare for life after football."\n\nWilson\'s total spend was $156,000 on Amazon\'s stock, which on Tuesday was trading around $1,907.84 per share. The stock is higher by 25 percent over the last year.\n\n"You have invested in my life," Wilson said in the letter.

The partnership expanded to 200 locations last month and Tuesday\'s announcement extends the relationship to every Kohl\'s location across the continental United States.\n\nKohl\'s will continue selling Amazon\'s hardware products in its stores, including smarthome products.\n\n### Why It\'s Important\n\nAmazon and Kohl\'s share a "passion in providing outstanding customer service," Kohl\'s CEO Michelle Gass said in the press release. The partnership also leverages Kohl\'s strong footprint across the country with Amazon\'s omnichannel strength.\n\nKohl\'s stock gained more than 7 percent Tuesday morning following the announcement. This could be interpreted as a sign the department store established a competitive advantage within the crowded and competitive department store and retail segment.\n\n### What\'s Next\n\nAmazon customers will be able to bring their products without a box or label to more than 1,150 stores across 48 states starting in July. Kohl\'s will accept the items and handle packaging and shipping for free as part of its commitment to driving innovation and traffic to stores.\n\nKohl\'s traded around $72.60 per share at time of publication.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Kohl\'s CEO Talks Focus On Wellness, Amazon Partnership With CNBC\'s Cramer_\n\n_Cowen: Speed-To-Market Initiatives Are Emerging Catalysts For Nike, Adidas, While Kohl\'s Leads In Private Label_\n\n_Photo courtesy of Kohl \'s._'
 '**Amazon.com, Inc**. (NASDAQ:AMZN) will close fulfillment centers in four states to retrofit them for other purposes, a move that will displace thousands of employees, and could lead to their departure from Amazon, the company confirmed on April 23 in response to a report earlier that day that appeared on Yahoo.\n\nAccording to the news report, the facilities to be closed are called "Amazon Robotics Quick Deploy," which handle small items and use Kiva orange robots that move shelves of goods to human pickers. The centers, located in California, Illinois, New Jersey and Texas, will be re-designed for use as sorting centers, Amazon Fresh delivery hubs and print-on-demand book sites, according to the report. An Amazon spokesperson told Yahoo that it has determined that various facilities are now better suited to handle different types of inventory than they have in the past.\n\nThe company didn\'t disclose how many centers would be closed or how many employees would be affected.\n\nAccording to the Yahoo article, Amazon workers last week were offered the chance to relocate to nearby sites where they would work similar jobs and schedules. Workers could also seek opportunities at other U.S. locations or elsewhere within the company, but would have to secure a job by June 14 or they would be terminated, according to the report. At the time they were notified, the affected employees were given 10 days to choose between the two options. The deadline for their decision is unclear.\n\nSeparately, Amazon and retailer **Kohl \'s, Inc**. (NYSE:KSS) said yesterday they will expand a program to all Kohl\'s contiguous U.S. stores that will allow Amazon customers to bring returned goods to Kohl\'s locations for processing and pick-up.\n\nThe expansion, which will take effect in July, will cover all of Kohl\'s 1,150 stores in the lower 48 states. The program began as a pilot in 2017 and is now available at 100 Kohl\'s stores in Chicago, Los Angeles and Milwaukee.\n\nUnder the program, Kohl\'s accepts eligible Amazon items without a box or label, and returns them for free.\n\nImage sourced from Google\n\nWant more content like this?

Is the new relationship a "game changer" for Kohl\'s?\n\n### The Analysts\n\nUBS\' Jay Sole maintains a Neutral rating on Kohl\'s with an unchanged $72 price target.\n\nMorgan Stanley\'s Kimberly Greenberger maintains at Underweight, unchanged $58 price target. \n\n### UBS: Upside Isn\'t Fully Priced In\n\nKohl\'s stock gained more than 10 percent after confirming its partnership expansion and the double-digit move doesn\'t fully incorporate the true potential, Sole said in a research report. Even though initial details are limited, the fact Amazon chose to partner with Kohl\'s likely implies it\'s a best-in-class off-mall department store.\n\nThe agreement also allows Amazon to buy 1.47 million shares of Kohl\'s stock at an exercise price of $69.68. Sole said it would be reasonable to guess Amazon is assuming the partnership will result in Kohl\'s gaining a "meaningful amount" of new business so it can earn a profit on the stock. Perhaps more important, Amazon taking a stake in Kohl\'s would lower its need to seek out other partners to help manage returns.\n\nKohl\'s made it clear in the early stages of the relationship it\'s only interested in an expansion if it makes economic sense for it to do so. Since the partnership will soon expand across the U.S., Sole said there is "no reason to doubt" Kohl\'s is benefiting financially and this deal could be a potential "game changer" in the retail space.\n\n### Morgan Stanley: But What About Cost?\n\nKohl\'s is likely to see a boost in traffic to stores from the Amazon partnership, but Greenberger said it\'s not clear if this can be sustained over time. Kohl\'s is handling the SG&A expenses, including processing returns at no cost to the customer. The department store can take advantage of empty space in its trucks that are already leaving its stores.\n\nIt\'s not year clear if the incremental revenue and gross profit dollars from the partnership will more than offset the incremental costs.\n\nWhen the deal was confirmed, the warrants had a value of around $25 million but at Tuesday\'s $75.48 closing price the warrants have a value of around $30 million. It\'s clear how Amazon benefits financially from this aspect of the deal, but the analyst is "puzzled" as to why Kohl\'s agreed to essentially give away free value.\n\n### Price Action\n\nKohl\'s stock traded lower by 2 percent at $74.10 per share Wednesday morning.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Cowen: Speed-To-Market Initiatives Are Emerging Catalysts For Nike, Adidas, While Kohl\'s Leads In Private Label_\n\n_Goldman Sachs Picks 3 Buys, 1 Sell In Retail:\'We Expect The Better Growth Outlook To Persist\'_\n\n_Photo credit: MB298,via Wikimedia Commons_\n\n**Ally Financial, Inc.** (NYSE:ALLY) recently released the results of its quarterly survey of more than 300 independent investors. The survey is an important litmus test for investor sentiment for the quarter ahead. With the **SPDR S &P 500 ETF Trust** (NYSE:SPY) already up 17.2 percent year-to-date, the investors surveyed are optimistic the market strength will continue.\n\n"The results of our Q2 outlook survey indicate that many investors view a few major issues, such as Brexit and slowing corporate growth, as either already built into the market or not threatening enough to limit their opportunities," Ally Invest president Lule Demmissie said.\n\nAlly found interest in the popular FAANG group of stocks, **Facebook, Inc.**(NASDAQ:FB), **Apple, Inc.**(NASDAQ:AAPL), **Amazon.com, Inc.**(NASDAQ:AMZN), **Netflix, Inc.** (NASDAQ:NFLX) and **Alphabet, Inc.** (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), has declined in the past three months.\n\n### Survey Says...\n\nHere are some of this quarter\'s major findings in regards to the overall market:\n\n  * Bearish sentiment among investors dropped from 47 percent in the first quarter survey to just 20 percent in the second quarter survey.\n  * Bullish sentiment doubled to 35 percent compared to the beginning of the year.\n  * Respondents named unchanged interest rates and economic trade agreements as the two biggest reasons for their bullish outlook.\n  * Despite the bullish shift in investor sentiment, at least half of investors still see a potential recession (62 percent), negative international trade news (52 percent) and the tumultuous U.S. political environment (50 percent) as near-term threats to the stock market.\n  * Only 25 percent of respondents said Brexit is a potential issue for investors.\n\n\n\nCoincidentally, the S&P 500 closed Tuesday at a new all-time high of 2,933.68.\n\nEnthusiasm for FAANG stocks dropped from 44 percent in the first quarter to 35 percent in the second quarter, down from 41 percent a year ago.\n\n  * Despite the decline in interest, most investors expect the FAANG group to meet or exceed investor expectations in the second quarter.\n  * Investors are most bullish on Amazon, with 65 percent expecting the company to meet or exceed expectations.\n  * Investors also expect Google (57 percent), Netflix (53 percent) and Apple (53 percent) to meet or exceed expectations this quarter.\n  * Investors remain cautious on Facebook, with only a third (33 percent) expecting the stock to meet or exceed market expectations.\n\n\n\nTraders will get a chance to see how accurate the Ally survey is when the FAANG stocks report first-quarter earnings on the dates below:\n\n  * Facebook reports on April 24 after the close.\n  * Apple reports on April 30 after the close.\n  * Amazon reports on April 25 after the close.\n  * Netflix reported a 33-percent EPS beat on April 16.\n  * Alphabet reports on April 29 after the close.\n\n\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Facebook Q1 Earnings Preview: What The Street Expects _\n\n_Experts Weigh In On Cuts To Federal Reserve Growth Projections_\n\n**Ford Motor Company** (NYSE:F) announced Wednesday a strategic partnership with and $500 million minority investment in Michigan-based **Rivian Automotive**.\n\nAs part of the arrangement, Ford will use Rivian\'s platform in a new battery electric vehicle, and it will add Joe Hinrichs, president of Automotives, to Rivian\'s board of directors.\n\n### **Why It \'s Important**\n\nRivian expects to begin deliveries on two vehicle models late next year. The R1T and R1S boast a range of 400 miles and are expected to sell for $68,000. The all-electric pick-up and SUV directly compete with **Tesla Inc**(NASDAQ:TSLA)\'s lineup.\n\n"As we continue in our transformation of Ford with new forms of intelligent vehicles and propulsion, this partnership with Rivian brings a fresh approach to both," Ford President and CEO Jim Hackett said in a press release. "At the same time, we believe Rivian can benefit from Ford\'s industrial expertise and resources."\n\nThe agreement is big news for Ford as it struggles to match pace with rival automakers.\n\nIn February, **General Motors Company**(NYSE:GM) was said to be in talks to invest in the electric-vehicle startup. Shortly after, Rivian announced a $700 million investment round led by **Amazon, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) but made no mention of GM.\n\nAs of yet, Rivian remains an independent company.\n\n### **What \'s Next**\n\nThe investment remains subject to regulatory approval.

 '**Amazon.com, Inc**. (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported late Thursday a 17 percent increase in first quarter net sales to $59.7 billion, in line with analysts\' estimates. Operating income rose to $4.4 billion from $1.9 billion, while net income climbed to $3.6 billion from $1.6 billion, resulting in a more than doubling of earnings per diluted share to $7.09 a share.\n\nOperating cash flow rose 89 percent to $34 billion, Amazon said. The figure tracks results for the 12-month period ending March 31, 2019.\n\nFulfillment costs rose to $8.6 billion from $7.7 billion, Amazon said. Shipping costs hit $7.32 billion, a 21 percent year-over-year increase, Amazon said. Shipping cost increases have been in the low-20 percent range for the past three quarters. By contrast, shipping expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 and in the first two quarters of 2018 rose by 31 percent, 38 percent and 31 percent, respectively, over each prior-year quarter.\n\nThat the pace of shipping expense growth has moderated over the past six quarters while volumes have substantially increased during the period may indicate that the company is deriving some savings by moving a larger proportion of shipments on its own equipment rather than outsourcing the transportation. It may also reflect that the company has, in general, become more proficient in moving goods.\n\nIt is estimated that Amazon transports between 10 to 12 percent of its goods, a ratio that is expected to rise as it brings on more aircraft and trucks, and increases its utilization of the nation\'s rail network.\n\nAmazon executives will hold an analysts call at 5:30 p.m. EDT to discuss the results.\n\nImage sourced from Pixabay\n\nWant more content like this?

Some years have seen low single-digit increases, at best. For most of the 21st century, industry-wide domestic air growth has been moribund as shippers eschewed high-priced delivery services in favor of less-expensive ground transport. As part of a major restructuring  in November 2012, **FedEx Corp**. (NYSE:FDX), UPS\' chief rival, said it would redirect capital expenditure funding away from air express - what was always FedEx\'s core business - and to its faster-growing ground parcel service.\n\nThe question is whether the UPS first quarter volume surge is an outlier, or the shape of things to come. If the latter, it could mark a turn in fortunes for a segment that had been a dominant force in U.S. commerce during the 1970s, 1980s and much of the 1990s. It may also augur a profound change in the U.S. shipping landscape. Steve Gaut, a UPS spokesman, noted that first quarter 2018 U.S. air volumes rose 6.9 percent over the same period in 2017. He said the trend shows that companies want and need more rapid transit times. Since 2017, UPS has ordered 40 freighters for its air fleet, which Gaut said demonstrates "our confidence that domestic and air volume growth will continue."\n\nThough no one at UPS will say it publicly, the catalyst for the growth surge could be **Amazon.com, Inc.  **(NASDAQ:AMZN), which, as it happens, also reports its first quarter results on April 25. Amazon customers have been conditioned to expect one- or two-day deliveries as a matter of course. In turn, they are imposing the same expectations on the rest of the economy. Rather than risk losing business, producers and retailers alike are being forced to migrate from ground deliveries to higher-priced air to satisfy demands for fast delivery.\n\nThe heightened interest in air services is not lost on UPS, FedEx or any other company that considers itself an airfreight provider. For several years, UPS and FedEx, which have a near-duopoly on business-to-business parcel traffic and a strong position in the business-to-consumer segment, have been jacking up air shipping rates. These rates, along with increases in value-added charges known as accessorials, are driving up shipping costs at a pace twice that of inflation, according to Rob Martinez, co-founder and CEO, of Shipware LLC, a consultancy. Shippers, many of whom feel straight-jacketed to find a lower-cost option, typically have no choice but to pay up, Martinez said.\n\nThroughout today\'s analyst call, UPS executives repeatedly referred to pursuing "higher-quality revenue" opportunities. According to Martinez, this is "Wall Street speak" for the residual effect of continued rate increases.\n\nMartinez said he\'s seeing dozens of high-volume e-commerce companies that are using ground distribution where two- to three-day guaranteed delivery windows are involved, and are utilizing air for everything else. The growing relevance of air is a "new trend, and the first time we\'re seeing this on a mass scale," he said.\n\nTo complicate matters for retailers, consumers increasingly demand free shipping, a trend that is only intensifying. Caught between higher shipping rates and an inability to recoup those costs from customers, retailers are in an ever-tightening bind. They either absorb the higher costs or, as the growing list of bankruptcies and store network closures demonstrate, either re-trench or go out of business.\n\nImage sourced from Pixabay\n\nWant more content like this?

Shares of Amazon garner a weight of 24 percent in the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector Index (IXYTR), more than double the weight assigned to the benchmark\'s second-largest component.\n\nThat means Amazon earnings could be impactful for the **Direxion Daily Consumer Discretionary Bull 3X Shares** (NYSE:WANT) and the **Direxion Daily Consumer Discretionary Bear 3X Shares** (NYSE:PASS).\n\n### **Why It \'s Important **\n\nThe bullish WANT aims to deliver triple the daily returns of the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector Index while the bearish PASS seeks triple the daily inverse returns of that benchmark. With Amazon\'s penchant for sizable post-earnings moves, either PASS or WANT could useful for short-term traders in the coming days.\n\nShares of Amazon are up 26.62 percent year-to-date and every one of the 45 analysts covering the stock is bullish, suggesting that WANT could be the way to play Amazon earnings or that the trade is crowded and PASS could be poised for short-term gains.\n\nSome data points indicate traders are leaning toward the bullish WANT. For the five days ending Tuesday, April 23rd, volume in WANT was almost 46 percent above the trailing 20-day average, according to Direxion data.\n\n### **What \'s Next **\n\nObviously, Amazon is the name that moves the consumer discretionary sector, but there are more potential near-term catalysts for WANT and PASS. During the week of April 29, more than 13 percent of the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector Index reports earnings.\n\n_Related Links_\n\n_New Weed ETF Already Adding Stocks_\n\n_Big Moves Could Be Coming For These ETFs_\n\nWall Street analysts gushed over yet another strong quarter from **Microsoft Corporation**(NASDAQ:MSFT) as investors pumped the computing giant\'s stock even higher.\n\nReactions on the Street ranged from astonishment over what one analyst called a "no blemishes" quarter to those no longer astonished because strength in Microsoft\'s cloud business seems now to be the norm, with another analyst calling it "another boringly excellent quarter."\n\nThe reaction also included praise for CEO Satya Nadella and his move to guide the former software maker into the new world of cloud computing, which is what\'s driving the strength at the company.\n\n### The Analysts\n\n  * Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives reiterated an Outperform rating on Microsoft, raising the price target from $150 to $155.\n  * Canaccord Genuity\'s Richard Davis reiterated a Buy rating with a $120 price target.\n  * UBS analyst Jennifer Swanson Lowe reiterated a Buy rating while raising the target price from $125 to $150.\n  * Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Kash Rangan raised the target price from $150 to $155 while reiterating a Buy rating.\n  * Morgan Stanley\'s Keith Weiss kept an Overweight rating on the stock, with a price target hike from $140 to $145.\n  * Raymond James analyst Michael Turits reiterated a Strong Buy rating, raising the target price from $142 to $149.\n\n\n\n### The Theses\n\nMicrosoft\'s results were "another feather in the cap for Nadella in the company\'s quest to become a cloud behemoth as Azure grew 73 percent year over year and continues to gain share" over **Amazon.com Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN)\'s cloud business, Ives wrote in a very bullish note to investors. "This quarter was an absolute \'blow out quarter\' across the board with no blemishes and in our opinion speaks to an inflection point in deal flow as more enterprises pick Redmond for the cloud."\n\n"Another boringly excellent quarter," Davis wrote. "Both the shiny object of growth drivers and the \'legacy\' component of the firm\'s operations grew faster than even our upside hopes."\n\nSwanson Lowe expects Microsoft\'s Commercial Cloud business to grow to $104 billion by fiscal 2023 with Azure driving $50 billion of the increase.\n\n"We see existing workloads moving into the Cloud and more likely to be created in the Cloud, as companies invest in Digital Transformation," she said.\n\nRangan said the latest earnings report validates projections of a "sustained beat and raise cycle" for Microsoft.\n\nStrong growth in its public cloud business, machine learning and Internet of Things are driving double digit top-line growth, while management is getting better operational efficiency and margins out of the business.\n\nTurits says Microsoft is a top-three cloud vendor, along with Amazon and**Alphabet Inc.** (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\'s Google, but has advantages over the other two competitors. Microsoft\'s advantages include the ability to driver profits through other stackable products, from Office 365 to artificial intelligence.\n\nInvestors were also impressed, as Microsoft shares rose 3.4 percent to $129.33.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Microsoft Again Beats Street On Cloud Computing Strength_\n\n_Azure Skies Ahead For Microsoft? Analysts Like Continued Cloud Computing Growth_\n\nCompanies have been generally beating very low expectations during this corporate earnings season. That\'s probably why the market is near highs, but it doesn\'t seem like the S&P 500\'s (SPX) record close earlier in the week generated as much follow-through buying as might have been expected. \n\nWith stocks near all-time highs, investors and traders may not be sure how to proceed. But for now, volatility remains muted as investors continue to watch earnings season unfold.\n\nThis morning, index futures were mixed. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures took a beating after **3M Co** (NYSE:MMM) reported earnings and revenue that missed expectations, announced 2,000 layoffs, and cut its 2019 earnings forecast. But with MMM making up less of the overall mix of the S&P 500, futures for that index were faring better.\n\nAnd tech-heavy Nasdaq futures were doing the best of the big three index futures after solid earnings reports from **Facebook, Inc.** (NASDAQ:FB) and **Microsoft Corporation** (NASDAQ:MSFT). \n\nFB shares were up more than 8% in pre-market trading this morning after the social media giant reported better-than forecast revenue. The story certainly seems to have shifted from where the company was just a few months ago.\n\nFB said it had 1.56 billion daily active users and 2.38 billion monthly active users. Average revenue per user of $6.42 beat expectations. Facebook, Messenger, and WhatsApp Stories features now have 500 million daily active users. \n\nMeanwhile, MSFT reported earnings and revenue that beat analyst expectations, helped by sales in the company\'s cloud business, and **Tesla Inc.** (NASDAQ:TSLA) reported a much bigger loss than expected as revenue was less than forecast. \n\n### Market Takes a Breather \n\nMixed earnings reports and uncertainty at new highs didn\'t leave the market with reason to move higher Wednesday, and all three major U.S. indices ended the day in the red. Participants may also have been keeping some powder dry ahead of earnings from MSFT and FB and with **Amazon.com, Inc.**  (NASDAQ:AMZN) and **Intel Corporation** (NASDAQ:INTC) reporting Thursday.\n\nInvestors and traders may have been moving into bonds, as an index measuring German business morale unexpectedly fell. The decline in morale comes amid worries about slowing global growth as the U.S.-China trade war drags on. On that front, the White House said U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will head to Beijing for another round of negotiations to begin on April 30 and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will be in Washington for more talks to start on May 8.\n\nThe German data also pressured the euro, even as the dollar got some strength on support from stronger-than-expected new home sales data. \n\nNew home sales in March rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 692,000, when a Briefing.com consensus had expected a reading of 646,000. The housing market, which has been hamstrung by affordability issues, was helped by a decline in the median sales price and lower mortgage rates.\n\n### Mixed Earnings, Energy Keep Street Subdued\n\nThe housing data didn\'t seem to help stocks too much on Wednesday, as earnings were mixed and energy shares stumbled.\n\n**Caterpillar Inc** (NYSE:CAT) beat third-party analysts\' estimates on earnings and revenue and raised guidance, but its shares ended the day more than 3% lower. One of its executives warned the company could lose market share in China, comments that apparently outweighed the strong earnings. The company also reported higher costs that ate into margins. \n\nAlso, sometimes when you see a stock fall despite an earnings beat, it could mean a "whisper" number was out there that was even higher than the results. Or some investors might be discounting the better guidance because part of it is based on a tax benefit.\n\nIn a reverse image, **Boeing Co** \'s (NYSE:BA) shares gained slightly even though the aircraft manufacturer missed third-party estimates, pulled its earnings guidance, and stopped its share buyback program in the wake of the March crash of its 737 MAX, the second MAX crash in six months. BA said it would wait to post new guidance until it has more clarity on the aircraft\'s fate. \n\nThe slight rise in the company\'s shares could be because investors and traders were expecting bad news and there may have been some relief that the company\'s report wasn\'t worse than it was. \n\nIn a stock move that perhaps makes more sense on the surface, **AT &T Inc. **(NYSE:T) shares dropped more than 4% after the wireless carrier missed revenue expectations. \n\nIn sector news, energy was decidedly unenergetic Wednesday. With a 1.85% slump, it was the SPX\'s worst performing sector of the day. \n\nU.S. oil futures declined following a larger-than-expected jump in U.S. crude inventories. The Energy Information Administration said stockpiles rose 5.5 million barrels last week when, according to Reuters, analysts had expected a build of just 1.3 million barrels.\n\n**Figure 1:** The U.S. dollar gained ground Wednesday on surprisingly strong U.S. housing data and as the euro slipped on disappointing data about business morale in Germany.

Past performance does not guarantee future results_.  \n\n**Allocation Check** : The question now that the market is near all-time highs might be whether we start to see some investors take a little money off the table, especially considering the popular but not necessarily valid old saying, "Sell in May and go away." While past isn\'t necessarily prologue, the late spring and summer months have often been weak ones on Wall Street. On the other hand, the market has slowly been grinding up all year despite a hitch here and there, and some analysts seem to think this slow grind may still be the path of least resistance. As long-term investors often hear, it may be a good time to check allocations and make sure this surge in stocks since Jan. 1 hasn\'t put you into a top-heavy position in terms of equities vs. fixed income. Sticking with long-term plans and goals often can be a good policy, rather than getting carried away by too much enthusiasm.\n\n**Onward and Upward?** The S&P 500\'s new record close on Tuesday comes amid a bull market that isn\'t short on superlatives. "This 12th bull market since WWII is now being referred to as a \'Lake Wobegon Bull\' since it is above average in terms of magnitude, duration, valuation and accompanying GDP growth," investment research firm CFRA said. This bull market has gained 334% from its low on March 9, 2009, compared to the median rise of 94% for all bull markets since WWII, the firm said. It\'s also been the longest, lasting for 122 months versus a median 55 months, CFRA said. "History says that even though a digestion of recent gains is likely, relatively low interest rates and inflation, combined with improving EPS growth projections, point to additional new highs in the period ahead," CFRA said. \n\n**Pessimism Overdone?** One theme of this earnings season has been low expectations from analysts forecasting corporate earnings per share. But BMO Capital Markets thinks the 7% that analysts lowered Q1 EPS expectations in the three months leading up to the reporting period has been excessive. "These lowered expectations have reignited talks of an earnings recession yet again with many market pundits predicting a disappointing reporting period and a significant pullback in US stocks," a BMO note on Wednesday said. "However, we reject this notion, and instead see flattish to slightly negative EPS growth for Q1, and a return to positive growth in the forthcoming quarters as companies surprise to the upside."\n\n_Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

After a brief stint with specialized consulting firms, Roberson now manages the logistics-focused market research firm, Logistics Trends & Insights LLC, which is based in Atlanta, Georgia._**\n\nIn a 2013 60 Minutes interview, **Amazon.com Inc.** \'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Jeff Bezos introduced his firm\'s delivery drones and predicted they could be operational in five years\' time. Perhaps Mr. Bezos put the cart before the horse in his expectations because a lot has happened and then again a lot has not happened since 2013.\n\nNumerous drone tests have popped up around the world and some tests have become actual service offerings, albeit limited ones. JD.com\'s drones have been delivering to China\'s rural areas for two years and its program recently received government approval for its first overseas test in Indonesia. DHL introduced their Parcelcopters in 2016 and utilizes the service in difficult to reach locations whether they are natural barriers or areas with poor infrastructure.\n\n**UPS**(NYSE:UPS) has also publicly embraced and demonstrated drone delivery for medical and emergency needs. In fact, last month, the company, along with drone partner Matternet, began the first revenue-producing drone flights sanctioned by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) - making multiple drone deliveries daily at the WakeMed hospital campus in Raleigh, North Carolina. These flights are reducing the need for multiple trips to the hospital via package car and thus reducing fuel consumption.\n\nThe FAA has adopted a very cautious approach to regulating drones. Some industry analysts have accused the agency for dragging its feet while others have applauded the cautious approach. To help establish rules and regulations, the FAA created an advisory board. This seemed to invigorate much needed action.\n\nIronically it was not Amazon that became the first drone delivery company to gain air carrier certification from the FAA but rather Google\'s Wing Aviation. The certification is limited but it clears the way for other firms looking to operate in the drone commerce space.\n\nWing will initially be restricted to areas of southwest Virginia and operate during the day when the weather is clear enough so that the drones can be seen. In addition, the **Google**(NASDAQ:GOOG) drone will not be allowed to fly above 400 feet.\n\nUsing an app, customers will select what they want delivered. This, in turn, will set the drone in motion. The aircraft will leave the nest, a staging area within a six-mile radius of deliveries, and then will hover about 20 feet and lower the package on a hook for final delivery.\n\nWhile one should appreciate the technology aspects of drones, one should also ask how viable as a last-mile solution are they? Some estimates suggest that the last-mile makes up about 30 percent, if not more, of total logistics costs. It\'s no surprise of companies\' interest in the potential of drones and for that matter other creative solutions such as crowd-sourced delivery options. However, serious consideration of where the deliveries are being made and a comparison of total costs to traditional delivery solutions should be made.\n\nAnother interesting drone experiment from UPS and one that could be a possibility for regular last-mile deliveries is one in which a drone launches from the top of a UPS package car. The drone autonomously delivers a package to a home and then returns to the vehicle while the delivery driver continues along a route to make a separate delivery. This could be beneficial in rural areas and also help reduce residential delivery costs.\n\nIt\'s good to see the FAA taking action on drone usage. There are a number of possibilities for drones when it comes to the last-mile but can they really help drive down delivery costs? That remains to be seen and it\'s likely we\'ll continue to see a number of tests before drones become an accepted and mainstream solution.\n\nImage Sourced From Facebook\n\nWant more content like this?

The mission appears to be to pull share from existing retailers whose customers will wonder why they, too, can\'t get one-day deliveries. It isn\'t necessarily to attract new customers who are agnostic about their e-delivery service, or to convert those who haven\'t used e-commerce at all. Shrinking transit times in half won\'t bring virgin business out of the woodwork. But it will bring business to Amazon that had been purchasing from another company.

Subscribe to the Fintech Focus newsletter to get a roundup of industry news delivered to your inbox weekly, and check out upcoming programming at Benzinga events._  \n  \nIn this episode of the Fintech Focus podcast, we enter the brokerage wars with Jeff Myers, co-founder and co-CEO of Gatsby.  \n  \nJust like the name of the eponymous book it gives a nod to, this Gatsby also sees the green light when it comes to opportunity--and that opportunity is giving people access to commission-free options trading.  \n  \nBy providing a clean, easy-to-use app and simplifying the options buying process, Gatsby is trying to do for options what Robinhood has done for stocks.  \n  \nAmong the things we discuss with Myers: how the app works, who it\'s meant for, payment for order flow, and why there\'s no such thing as something being "too easy."  \n  \nListen to the podcast below to hear how Myers is hoping to make the options world go gaga for Gatsby.\n\n### How did Gatsby come about?\n\nSo, my background is in technology and design. And actually, some people get a kick out of this--I hadn\'t traded options until a couple years ago. And essentially what my co-founder and I started to understand was that options are a really interesting financial tool because they\'re very conducive for this new generation of traders.\n\nOne, you can play around with an options contract. I\'m talking buying options. You can play around with an options contract with less money because you have more control over how much risk you want to talk. You can go further out of the money, and therefore you can actually buy a call on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) when you maybe couldn\'t afford a share. So, it\'s good for people with smaller accounts that sometimes want to play with stocks that are really expensive.\n\nBut we got really into options after that and realized that there\'s a need for a simplified no commission options trading app to bring new traders to the market.\n\n### What features are on the app right now?\n\nYeah, so you can buy puts and calls and we have a social feed. A lot of people who sign up for Gatsby email me and they say it looks like Venmo. It\'s a weird analogy because these are very different types of apps, totally different functions, but it does have this social feed just chronological list of all the trades that go through Gatsby to the extent that we\'re allowed to share. Obviously we\'re being ultra-compliant with FCC guidelines about integrating social feeds into a brokerage platform as it\'s nuances, but it\'s really cool because we see one of the more prolific traders on the platform, people start to see their faces more often, and they kind of find inspiration from them.\n\nSo, like, one trader one day will buy a put on x, y, z company and then over the course of the next couple hours, we see a couple other traders do that. So, it\'s kind of cool to see the community influence each other and find inspiration from each other. So that\'s, I think, a big feature for us. Especially for new traders, it\'s really cool to see what other people are doing. You get a sanity check before you do anything.\n\n### How has the last year plus differed from what you thought it might be like when you started?\n\nYeah, it\'s a great question. So getting a broker dealer license is obviously very complicated. My background has been just building apps and web applications and testing it with users and iterating on it really quickly. But you know, our COO basically says "Whoa, whoa, slow down. We have to go clear this with FINRA," or "We have to go clear this with our lawyer."\n\nAnd so that ... it\'s like a new experience for me. It\'s great and I understand that it\'s super important. So we\'re trying to surround ourselves with people that will slow us down, as the product people and the technology people that come from sort of the era of move fast and break stuff, and actually just do it by the book in the right way, work with the regulators, make sure that the T\'s are crossed, the I\'s are dotted, and also make sure, simultaneously, that the users are having a great experience.\n\n**Uber Technologies \'** executives and bankers will soon make their pitch to investors during its pre-IPO roadshow. CNBC\'s Leslie Picker offered her take on what the team\'s main selling points are likely to focus on.\n\n### \'Not As Risky\'?\n\nUber is pricing its IPO at around $86 billion on a fully diluted basis at the midpoint of its $80.5-$90.5 billion range. By comparison, Picker said, bankers at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley valued the company at $120 billion just six months ago.\n\nUber\'s corporate governance structure is "conciliatory" compared to other companies valued at $1 billion or more, she said. For example, the company is set up with one class of shares, an independent chairman and all directors need to stand election each year.\n\n"Uber and Lyft look incredibly similar in terms of cash burn and growth in user base," Shawn Cruz, senior trading specialist at TD Ameritrade told Benzinga. "That might be why you\'re seeing Uber coming in and be a little less aggressive with their pricing."\n\n### \'Reformed\' Culture\n\nPicker said Uber\'s history under Travis Kalanick had its share of controversy but the company highlighted in marketing materials it has "reformed" its culture. The company is collaborating appropriately with regulatory bodies to seek out and expand into new markets.\n\nUber\'s losses for the first three months of 2019 alone were around $1 billion. If the competitive landscape in Uber\'s two core markets of ride-hailing and food delivery doesn\'t ease, Picker said loses could continue.\n\nPicker said Uber\'s main selling point to investors is that it\'s an "Amazon-like company" with large losses today but can one day become a "mecca of transportation."\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Uber Plans Initial Price Range Of $44-$50 Per Share_\n\n_Ex-Uber Exec Talks Company\'s Roots, Path To Profitability_\n\n_Photo courtesy of Uber._\n\nAfter record-setting closes last week, the market this morning seems to be anticipating another busy week of earnings, a calendar full of economic reports and a rate decision from the Federal Reserve.\n\nTrade talks between the U.S. and China also appear to be at the fore as representatives from the world\'s two largest economies are scheduled to continue negotiations in Beijing. Ahead of the meeting, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told The New York Times that the two sides are "getting into the final laps" and have "made a lot of progress." \n\nOn the Chinese data front, numbers showed that industrial profits in the Asian nation rose in March. It\'s a good sign from an economy that has gotten beaten up by the trade war that has sparked worries about global economic growth.\n\nThe news comes ahead of a week that\'s packed with U.S. economic data reports. This morning, data on March core personal consumption expenditures, which are the Fed\'s preferred gauge of inflation, came in below a Briefing.com consensus expectation for a 0.1% rise. Consumer confidence figures are due out later in the week and might be interesting to compare with last week\'s consumer sentiment numbers. \n\nPerhaps the most closely watched number could be the nonfarm payrolls figure from the Labor Department. The report is another major benchmark for the economy, and it could be interesting to see whether we get another stronger-than-expected reading like we did last time.\n\nIn other big economic news this week, the Fed is expected to hold interest rates steady at its two-day policy setting meeting, CME futures prices suggest. Still, investors and traders are likely to parse the language accompanying the decision to see if they can glean any insight into the central bank\'s thinking on the trajectory of the economy and interest rates. \n\nThe week also includes earnings from **Apple Inc  **(NASDAQ:AAPL), **Alphabet**(NASDAQ:GOOG), **McDonald \'s Corp **(NYSE:MCD), **General Electric Company**  (NYSE:GE), and **Merck & Co, Inc. **(NYSE:MRK), among many others. \n\nThis earnings season has been characterized by very low expectations. But many companies have been reporting better earnings than were forecast, forming a big part of why the SPX and COMP closed at record highs. \n\nThe optimism is building on two issues that have already been helping the market rise strongly this year after slumping drastically late last year. One is that, even though the trade war between the world\'s two largest economies is dragging on, market participants seem to be seeing light at the end of that tunnel. Also, the Fed\'s dovish pivot--after fears last year that the central bank would end up being too aggressive despite low inflation--has boosted market sentiment. \n\n### GDP Porridge Just Right\n\nThe U.S. market finished up last week on a positive note, with the S&P 500 (SPX) and Nasdaq (COMP) posting record closes on Friday and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) also gaining ground after strong U.S. economic data.\n\nThe gains came after the Commerce Department in its first estimate of Q1 GDP said the benchmark measure of economic activity rose at a 3.2% annual rate. A Briefing.com consensus had expected a growth rate of 1.9%.\n\nThe strong print helped to allay fears about a faltering domestic economy amid worries about European and Chinese economic growth as the U.S.-China trade war drags on. \n\nIt also marks a resurgence of the Goldilocks economic scenario. The strong GDP number comes as the Fed has become much more dovish amid signs of muted inflation. So the picture Friday\'s data seems to paint for the U.S. economy is one where growth isn\'t too hot or too cold.\n\n### Earnings Season Continues\n\nThe market was also helped by **Amazon.com, Inc.**  (NASDAQ:AMZN) reporting a blowout quarter. Its shares rose more than 2.5% after the online retailing giant\'s earnings per share handily beat expectations.\n\nThe gains helped boost the Consumer Discretionary sector, a cyclical segment of the market that tends to do better as the economy performs more robustly, and vice versa. If people are feeling better about their job situation and spending power, they might be more inclined to splurge on an online shopping spree.\n\nOr, they might buy a truck. The biggest gainer in the sector on Friday was **Ford Motor Company**  (NYSE:F), which rallied more than 10.7% after reporting stronger-than-forecast earnings and revenues amid strong demand for pickup trucks and SUVs in North America. \n\nBut not all was rosy in earnings land. Exxon Mobil (XOM) reported profit that was roughly half of what it earned a year ago, and the earnings were well under analysts\' forecasts. Revenues also came up short, helping push the oil giant\'s shares down more than 2% and helping make the energy sector the day\'s biggest loser by far.\n\nOil prices also weighed on the sector as the U.S. crude price fell nearly 3% after President Trump said he had told OPEC the cartel had to bring down gasoline prices. The fall in oil prices comes after a sharp gain recently as the Trump administration said it would not extend waivers that would have allowed several countries to keep on buying Iranian oil.\n\nCrude prices continued to fall this morning. If the pressure continues, airlines and other transportation companies would stand to benefit from a resulting fall in fuel prices. \n\nMeanwhile, in M&A news in the industry, **Anadarko Petroleum Company** (NYSE:APC) said it would resume talking with **Occidental Petroleum** (NYSE:OXY), which has offered $38 billion for Anadarko compared with **Chevron Corporation** \'s (NYSE:CVX) roughly $33 billion bid. \n\n**Figure 1:** Oil prices dropped sharply Friday after President Trump said he had told OPEC to lower fuel costs.

Past performance does not guarantee future results_.  \n\n**GDP Drilldown** : Trade has been in the news for months now as the United States and China have slapped tit-for-tat tariffs on billions of dollars of goods from each other and headlines about negotiations between the world\'s two largest economies have captivated Wall Street. Trade also figured prominently in the surprisingly strong GDP reading on Friday. The United States\' exports of goods and services rose 3.7% on a seasonally adjusted annual rate while imports declined by the same percentage. That left net exports to contribute more than 1 percentage point to the headline GDP number. But it\'s probably worth noting that the net export component is a volatile piece of the GDP puzzle. Plus, the government still has two more chances to revise the number.  \n\n**Texas Sized Exports** : They say everything\'s bigger in Texas. That proved true for exports from the Lone Star State in January and February. Exports from the state topped $50 billion during the period, representing roughly 20% of all U.S. exports, according to data from WISERTrade reported by CNBC. Exports during the period grew 9% from the previous year, handily beating national export growth of 2.6%, the article noted. What drove the Texas-sized exports? You guessed it: oil and gas. If you\'ll recall, oil prices were on the rise in January and February, and, according to the article, Texas oil and gas exports jumped in value by 45%. As oil prices have continued to gain ground amid OPEC-led supply cuts and U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and Iran, it could be interesting to see whether the next batch of data will show Texas exports continuing to outstrip the national figures. \n\n**Going Shopping?** Friday was a good day for U.S. economic news. On top of the sterling GDP report, the University of Michigan\'s consumer sentiment index for April showed a reading of 97.2 when a Briefing.com consensus had expected a print of 96.7. That\'s a good sign for the U.S. economy, which is heavily dependent on consumer spending. The strong number may have added to help from AMZN earnings to help boost the consumer discretionary sector by 0.93% on Friday. "The key takeaway from the report is that 44% of consumers said they were feeling better about their financial prospects for the year ahead," Briefing.com said. "That is the highest level for that reading since 2004 and another indication that should quiet recession talk."\n\n_Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

Shares of rival retailers fell Friday as Street analysts said Amazon\'s shipping initiative could be a "game changer" in the retail sector.\n\nWalmart\'s response is short on detail as the retail giant teased its response in a tweet.\n\n> One-day free shipping...without a membership fee. Now THAT would be groundbreaking. Stay tuned.\n> \n> -- Walmart (@Walmart) April 26, 2019\n\n### Why It\'s Important\n\nWalmart shouldn\'t experience any difficulties in matching Amazon\'s one-day shipping, Bloomberg quoted Sanford Bernsetin Brandon Fletcher as saying in a research report. The analyst said one-day shipping is "neither shocking nor difficult" for Walmart given its large scale.\n\nFletcher has first-hand experience having worked in Walmart\'s strategy and operations department, Bloomberg said. Walmart boasts 156 distribution centers and upgrading its facilities to allow one-day shipping shouldn\'t require heavy investment\n\n### What\'s Next\n\nFletcher\'s report also highlighted a previous research report by consultants at A.T. Kearney, which said Walmart would need to add eight additional distribution facilities to offer one-day shipping to clients.\n\nWalmart\'s stock closed Friday\'s session at $101.53 per share. Amazon closed at $1,950.63 per share.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Walmart Earnings Give Amazon A Run For Its Money_\n\n_Winning India: Walmart Vs. Amazon_'
 '**UPS Inc.** (NYSE:UPS) employees who are members of Teamsters Union Local 243 in Detroit ratified their local rider to the national, or "master" UPS contract on Sunday, April 28, allowing the five-year contract to take effect.\n\nThe unofficial vote was 295 for and 121 against. This means that the five-year collective-bargaining agreement goes into effect retroactive to July 31, 2018. The national, or master contract, which covers about 250,000 UPS Teamsters, could not be implemented until all regional and local agreements were ratified.\n\nA number of Teamsters locals originally rejected their respective supplements. However, each subsequently voted for ratification.\n\nThe ratification process was unusual in that more than half of all voting Teamsters rejected the master contract. However, under the Teamsters constitution, a contract is considered ratified if less than half of the eligible voters cast ballots and less than two-thirds of those who voted cast ballots. About 44 percent of eligible UPS Teamsters voted, and the margin of defeat fell quite short of a two-thirds rejection.\n\nThe outcome sparked calls by some within the Teamsters community for eliminating the so-called two-thirds provision from the Teamsters constitution, and making that effort a top priority.\n\nPerhaps the most controversial language in the master contract establishes a two-tier wage structures for workers not on the standard Monday-through-Friday pick-up and delivery schedule. Those workers will be on shifts that encompass weekend dates, a nod to the proliferation of Sunday deliveries spawned by the growth of e-commerce.\n\nIn the past couple of years, **Amazon.com, Inc**. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and the U.S. Postal Service have offered a ground service on Sundays on a limited basis. UPS has never operated on Sundays, and only in the past couple of years began ground parcel service on Saturday.\n\nImage sourced from Google\n\nWant more content like this?
