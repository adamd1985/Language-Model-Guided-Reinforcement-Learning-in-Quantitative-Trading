  Instructions: |
    Develop a LONG or SHORT trading strategy for a single stock only for the next Month that aligns with the `portfolio_objectives` and `risk_profile`. Follow these guidelines:

    1. Stock Analysis:
       - Evaluate price trends: Compare the Close price against 20MA, 50MA, and 200MA to assess momentum or reversals.
       - Analyze returns: Use Weekly Past Returns to validate trend sustainability.
       - Contextualize volatility: Align `HV_Close` and `HV_High` with recent price action for trend validation and risk management.
       - Incorporate beta: Use `beta` to gauge sensitivity to market movements.
       - High-Risk: Levarage high-beta trend for momentum surges.
       - Low-Risk: Focus on low `beta` and volatility.
       - ICL Example: "Close price above 20MA and 50MA with steep 20MA slope signals bullish momentum. Weekly returns confirm a sustainable uptrend."

    2. Technical Analysis:
       - Use RSI: Identify momentum signals (>70 overbought; <30 oversold) and divergences for reversals.
       - Validate with `MACD`: Use crossovers of `MACD.Value` and `Signal_Line`, and `MACD_Strength` for directional confidence.
       - High-Risk: Leverage `RSI.value` divergences, and steep `Moving_Averages` slopes.
       - Low-Risk: Focus on stable `Moving_Averages` patterns.
       - ICL Example: "RSI at 65, a positive MACD crossover indicate bullish momentum."

    3. Fundamental Analysis:
       - Evaluate growth metrics: Use `EPS_YoY`, `Net_Income_YoY`, and `Free_Cash_Flow_YoY`for profitability and sustainability.
       - Prioritize ratios: Low `Debt_to_Equity_Ratio` and `Current_Ratio` reflect financial stability, especially in low risk confic
       - High-Risk: Focus on aggressive `Growth Metrics`.
       - Low-Risk: Emphasize steady margins, cash flow, and moderate leverage.
       - ICL Example: "EPS YoY growth of 25% and low Debt-to-Equity ratio of 0.5 support strong financial health, aligning with a LONG strategy."

    4. Macro Analysis:
      - Align with market sentiment across `Macro_Data`:
        - "SPX_Close_Slope > 0 && VIX_Close_Slope < 0" → Bullish (Risk-On)
        - "SPX_Close_Slope < 0 && VIX_Close_Slope > 0" → Bearish (Risk-Off)
      - Validate with `Economic_Data`:
        - "GDP_QoQ > 0 && PMI > 50" leads to Economic Expansion
        - "M2_Growth > 8% && ISM_Prices_Paid > 50 && Durable_Goods > 0" Increases Inflationary Pressures
        - "Yield_Curve(10Y-2Y) < 0" Signals Recession Risk, especially if already mentioned in `Rationale`.

      - ICL Examples:
        - "SPX_Close_Slope > 0 && VIX_Close_Slope < 0 We have Market Confidence, leverage high-risk actions for a risk profile"
        - "M2 Growth > 8% && Rising ISM Prices Paid we have an Inflationary Environment, low risk actions for low risk profile"
        - "GDP_QoQ Falling && PMI < 50 We have an Economic Slowdown, low risk trades for low risk profile, or high risk actions for high risk profiles"

    5. Options Analysis:
      - Compare `OTM_Skew`, `ATM_Skew`, and `ITM_Skew` IV Skews: Assess differences to gauge market sentiment and directional bias using their `20Day_Moving_Averages`.
      - High-Risk Strategies: Leverage IV spikes to capitalize on speculative directional trades.
      - Low-Risk Strategies: Focus on balanced IV levels and consistent HV for steady, lower-risk trades.
      - Example: "Rising ATM IV skew > 0, market pricing up move, with stable HV supports a LONG position, as it indicates growing upside expectations without excessive fear."

    6. Performance Reflection and Strategic Adaptation:
      - If `Last_Strategy_Used_Data` is available:
        - Outcome Evaluation:
            - Assess the outcome of the previous strategy by examining `last_returns` and the chosen `last_action`.
            - Determine if the result aligns with the expectations outlined in the previous `Rationale`.
            - Identify if the direction (LONG or SHORT) led to desirable or undesirable outcomes.
            - Compare assumptions in the previous `Rationale` with actual outcomes and current `User_Context`.
            - Identify logical inconsistencies, misinterpreted signals, or omitted influential features.
            - Use chain-of-thought reasoning to explain the gap between forecasted and observed behavior.
        - Confidence Adjustment:
            - Based on the observed gap and your reassessment, evaluate if `last_action_Confidence` was accurate.
            - Assign an updated Likert score (1 to 3) to your current `action_confidence`:
                - 1: Low confidence; contradictory or weak alignment across features.
                - 2: Moderate confidence; partial alignment with moderate evidence.
                - 3: High confidence; strong convergence across key features.
            - Risk-profile adjustment:
                - If `risk_profile` is "High-Risk", and your trade is high risk high reward, consider increasing `action_confidence` by +1, capped at 3.
                - If `risk_profile` is "Low-Risk" and downside risk is high, consider decreasing `action_confidence` by -1, floored at 1.
        - Feature Attribution:
            - Rank the importance of each major feature used in your current rationale using a Likert scale (1 to 3):
                - 1: Minimal contribution; not required for the decision.
                - 2: Moderate contribution; relevant but not critical.
                - 3: High contribution; pivotal to the trading decision.

Output:
  action: Str. LONG or SHORT.
  action_confidence: int. Likert scale (1-3) confidence in the proposed `action`, adjusted based on prior strategy outcome if `Last_Strategy_Used_Data` is available.
  explanation: >
    A concise rationale (max 350 words) justifying the proposed `action`.
    Include:
      - The top 5 weighted features used in the decision, each labeled with its Likert importance (1–3).
        (e.g., "Stock_Data.Price.Close, Weight 3, Technical_Analysis.RSI.Value, Weight 1, Options_Data.ATM_Skew, Weight 2")
      - A reflective assessment of `Last_Strategy_Used_Data`, including:
          - Whether the past `action` was successful and was it maintained given prior `Rationale`.
          - Whether prior confidence was justified and how this influenced the current decision.
